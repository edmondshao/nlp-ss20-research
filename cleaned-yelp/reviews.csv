I was craving a hamburger, a rare occasion, and was on my way to the Charlotte Outlet Center and saw this location just a few minutes away.
I arrived a few minutes past 12:00pm and the parking lot was empty...maybe that should have been a sign.

Upon walking in there were three or four servers standing around, and two line cooks.  They told me to sit ""wherever"". After choosing a booth the waitress brought me a menu and I decided to order the All American Cheeseburger with Fries and a Hot Dog, all the way. Why not try a few things to get a feel for what I might like.

Less then three minutes later my food arrived.
The burger was so overcooked, and tasted like packaged meat I was not impressed. And, I love all the toppings, lettuce, pickles, ketchup and mayo, but when the mayo overwhelms the entire burger it is a little too much.
The fries were definitely precooked and so overdone they weren't even edible. And, one thing I will add, which I saw in another review, they over salt everything. And, I love me some salt, but I couldn't even do it.

As for the hot dog, I don't think I have ever seen a neon pink hot dog before, nasty. The cole slaw and chili on top was straight out of a can and disgusting.

Obviously there are some great reviews, so I am not sure if I went on an off day, but based on the fact that Charlotte offers too many great hamburger and hot dog joints I will definitely not be returning to Hwy 55 anytime soon.",2018-10-06 22:29:38,0

I had to ask for my drink a couple of times to get it. It got never refilled. Order took around 40 minutes to come out (we had a 1, 1 1/2, and 3 year old with us) so imagine how stressed we were since food wasn't being served on time. Placed wasn't full at all so I wasn't expecting to take that long. 

Finally food came and the order was wrong, it was missing all the toppings we ordered on 2 burgers (except for lettuce) (it was a simple order, nothing out of the ordinary)
I didn't even get a ""I am sorry"", I waited a few more minutes but decided not to eat. 

I was still charged for the rest of the food.

I watched her press buttons on the touchscreen register to process my payment as an adult employee watched and supervised,  I guess.  My first act upon leaving the restaurant was to call the non emergency number for the police.  There was no answer so I called 911 and told them it wasn't an emergency but here's what is going on and can they send someone to remind these people that child labor is illegal.  They gave me the non emergency number for the sheriff department.  I called and reported the facts and asked again if they could send someone.

I got sick, so I think they use msg.
There were fried onion rings fried shrimp fried fish stick things, grilled cheese?  Basically the simplest defrosted food you could think of.  You could tell from that boxed freezer food type batter. 

They're good about clearing plates and refilling the water, but there was not a single food that I could say wow this is  really good! I think I want to go get more.

Sitting in the furthest table from the entrance to get away from ultra smoke filled casino. They have a shuttle from parking areas with a tip cup. Very limited handicap parking. The food is average at best . The selection is small and unexciting. You have to get lucky to find an item you settle for. Went sat around 5pm no crowd.Prime rip special full of 70% fat. What's edible is good not great. The sliced pork roast chewed like rubber. The one sweedsh meatball with polenta corn bread was the highlight of dinner. 7 out of ten. The fried chicken breast was 8 1/2 and I don't like fried chicken but not much else that looked appealing. Friendly server friendly cooks just worth about a $12 dinner with take what we got or tougher luck $21 plus tax per person for no selection is a no brainer. One and done. Pay the extra $15 and so to their sister hotel talking stick and the buffet and crab legs are excellent and no smoke what so ever. Forgot the deserts. Vanilla ice cream machine terrible ice creams. Cookies look good tastes them all yech yuck and double yech! Just terribly made cookies. I wouldn't go back with a free dinner buffet for life coupon nor would I recommend it too my enemies. They need a total overhaul of the buffet and the selections and the small size of the food displays. Rate them 1 star. The best was average the worst gets one bite and garbage. Sorry the worst reviews are 100% accurate. If you aren't used to eating good food on a daily basis then the reviews that praise this place dont know any better. Here you definitely don't get what you pay for. !!!! If your thinking of trying it better off getting some pizzas at Walmart. They give you 6 choices.

It is basically take out but they have a couple of tables if you want to eat in. First of all I want to preface that whatever they make here is made with donuts.

When I arrived I ripped off a sheet where you can choose the number of donuts you want, toppings, glaze, and drizzle. They were giving out samples of sugared cinnamon donuts which I thought was a bit too much for me. Oh yes, they are also into souvenir shopping if you want to buy Tees and little rubber duckies. Some even have Pittsburgh written on it.

If you want a breakfast sandwich you can have it made with donuts. Care for a sundae? You can have a donut base with it. They do offer one special for $5.00 with the purchase of two donuts and a beverage. Since I was planning to go out to lunch I was only interested in a plain simple blueberry donut without all the frills. Coffee and tea is available from self serve machines.

i went to pay for my donut which came to a grand total of $1.40 since I didn't want all the stuff that you can get with it. Yes, if you customize it you pay more. They also provide the calorie count of each item if you are watching your weight or carbs. I was then given a number and in a few minutes my donut was served to me boxed.

The only good thing I liked about it was that it was soft and warm since it was made fresh. But it had no blueberry taste to it whatsoever. It just tasted like a plain donut! Hey if I'm buying a blueberry donut then I would expect to see some tiny pieces in it or at least taste it. Since I needed to be somewhere I didn't get the opportunity to complain about this matter.

I'm not a big donut fan but I do know that I prefer cake donuts to glazed over anytime. This store is a novelty and again I feel it is to bring something different in this new mall they are creating off Siena Dr. Expect long lines because people are usually ordering up to a dozen to take home and it is family oriented.

I walked up to the counter and handed it to the girl. It was surprisingly cheap running about $1.50 for a donut with toppings. The drinks where all around $2 to $4 bucks.

We showed up without reservations and with a 35 minute table wait, we opted to sit immediately at the Sushi Bar. The atmosphere was very nice - modern, clean, hip. The music was great - the perfect pre-game vibe you'd hope for during dinner at the Epicenter. 
I ordered the Lucy Lui Cosmo - excellent. At the manager's suggestion, we ordered some Sake2Me which was very different, summery and refreshing. For dinner we ordered a bunch of appetizers and thought they were all out of this world. We especially enjoyed the lettuce wraps and the vegetarian maki roll was hands down the best maki I've ever eaten. I thought our main dishes wouldn't be able to top the starters, but boy I was wrong! My spice-lovin' friend ordered the Sechuan Chicken and I got the Gonzo Chicken. We could have died and gone to Heaven! Our dishes were very different, but so flavorful, so well seasoned and savory, and the chicken just melted in the mouth. 
The service was great. It was a busy night, but our waiter was very attentive, refilling wine glasses, promptly appearing between courses, and was friendly and helpful when asked for his course and wine suggestions. The manager-  who I noticed was very hands-on, helping staff and guests with various needs and special requests - came over to ensure we'd had the optimal dining experience, and was interested and engaging to chat with.
Overall, my friend and I were very impressed with our first experience at Enso and we'll definately be returning in the near future. It's by far the best restaraunt in the Epicenter, and it was - from start to finish - the best meal I've eaten in a very long time!",2010-08-07 21:01:26,1

She comes back and doesn't even know how to pour from the side, water and ice go into my mothers food. She does nothing and comes back with another jug to fill my glass. 

Time goes by and we never see her. So how was she overwhelmed with a room where 6 out of 22 tables actually have customers. Mind you, he only other table has left at this point. 

She comes by: 
K: do you want the check now?
Mom: no, I'd like more water, please.

Mom: no, not yet, unless you think so (gestures to me)

The overuse of browning and sugar was unnecessary and certainly did not lend to improving the flavour, which was very much lacking. The coleslaw, well let's just say that there's more mayo than there is cabbage.

But what you could see of the kitchen left me suspect.  After I ordered my Jerk and Oxtail dinner along with Beef soup, I heard microwave buttons.
I was praying it was not my dinners but as I looked I could see them taking my food out of the microwave while it was already packed in the styrofoam containers.
Health risk!

I sucked it up, only to try the soup and rice and peas only to get the strongest scent of cloves I have ever smelled in my life.  Then after 1 taste I nearly could not hold the rice in my mouth as it tasted like I just opened a jar of cloves and swallowed it!
This is immensely disappointing for me as I really was hoping to have a place near my area to get authentic great tasting Jamaican food.

But after yesterday, I have to say this place has probably been taken off our list of regular spots. 

We decided to stop in on a Sunday afternoon for a bit of brunch before our 3 o'clock appointment. 2 hours should have been plenty of time, right? Apparently not. We were told the wait for a table would be about 20 minutes; 45 minutes later we were finally sat, after watching several tables remain empty on the patio the entire time we waited. Given those 45 minutes, we had plenty of time to look over the menu so we could put in our order right away. By the time we ordered our drinks and food (at the same time) it was about 2 o'clock. 

By 2:30, I'd had enough. Our waitress didn't check on us the entire time we sat there. 40 minutes without a table touch... 30 MINUTES. We finally tracked her down and told her we needed our food to-go, as we had somewhere to be. She assured us she'd go check on our food and have them put it together as quickly as possible. But this seems to be relative, as 10 minutes later she returns and tells us it'll be another 5 minutes before our food could be brought out. Unfortunately at this point, we'd already decided to pay the bill preemptively because, despite everything, we were hungry. Bad move on our part, I will say. 

Finally, our food was brought out by (what I assumed to be) a manager, because she gave us a gift certificate for our trouble. However, this seemed to be only an afterthought when my husband brought up how long we'd had to wait for a table and for our food on top of that. I felt it should have been our waitress that tracked down a manager for that sort of thing. 

On top of all of that, they put the wrong ingredients in my husband's order of the Bunny Rancheros. If the food was fantastic, I might be inclined to give them another chance. But, unfortunately, it's a bit average, and the headache is not worth it. Guess we'll have to find someone else to use our $25 certificate. Any takers?",2017-03-06 15:15:03,0

We were treated like an inconvenience and I was told ""I'm not trying to be an asshole but you'd be better off inside.""

The Eel Roll is simple and scrumptious, and the Soft Shell Crab Roll made for a nice finish.

I went for sushi with of a couple of girlfriends last night. I'm not brave enough to eat raw fish, so I usually go for shrimp tempura. I order the appetizer, which came with 4 pieces of shrimp and mixed veggies. The food came fast and was hot. After biting into my second piece of shrimp, a long vein (poop) fell out of the shrimp remaining in my hand. I have never been so disgusted! I cut into the remaining two pieces, and poop was in abundance. At this point, I'm finding it difficult to not puke on the bar. I ate poop! We notified the waitress, and she revealed that the shrimp came already prepared. $10 for frozen shrimp tempura is pretty expensive. She took away my plate with three of my four pieces of shrimp, and offered free ice cream. We passed.. It was cold and rainy outside. My check came, and I was charged for the meal. I was kind of shocked! 

I called the next day to speak to a manager, and a lady named ""G"" reluctantly offered to give me my money back. She never apologized, but seemed upset that I less than thrilled about being served dirty shrimp.

I was not sure what to expect, but at the prices for the burgers, I was expecting something good. Unfortunately, this restaurant failed to deliver.

Before I get to the food, I should point out a few things that really detracted from the dining experience. When I went into the restaurant, I noticed it was quite dark. After looking around the floor and seeing how dirty it was with the remains of food and even a spilled drink, I concluded that the lack of lighting is to hide how poorly the establishment is cleaned. There also seemed to be a lack of servers, and the wait time for everything was quite long. Finally, the air conditioning was either not working properly or was set high, as it felt very hot inside and I saw someone at the table in front of me using a makeshift fan.

I ordered a burger using the make your own option. While the burger itself was not bad, the toppings were mediocre at best. I did not like how both the ketchup and mustard were very spicy, and the lettuce and tomato were not appetizing looking at all. 

For the prices that were being charged, even with a coupon, the food should have been better.

I Was kind of hoping for some eggplant, roasted red peppers, grilled zucchini, you know a real veggie hoagy with some flavor and texture. Oh we'll, live and learn. Still no soup! Finally the bartender was finished watching TV and saw we were both out of beer, and I asked about the soup, he apologized and said he forgot. I said to Ross, I guess he must make a good hourly wage because he's not working for a good tip. Finally our soup was delivered and I pushed away that lousy hoagy and dived into soup.

Being that I was in the Pittsburgh area, I figured I'd give this hole-in-the-wall a try, especially since Guy Fieri recommended it (although I am starting to doubt his taste because, frankly, all his suggestions have blown thus far). 

We get here and it's confusing from the start. The guy from the back (does he cook the food? wash the dishes?) seats us in the dark bar area. He asks us what we want to drink and tells someone to get us Diet Pepsi (we ordered regular Pepsi). We get the menus and I was tempted to get out a flashlight just to read it. 

In the meantime, a waitress comes over and asks us what we want to drink. We tell her Pepsi. She walks off. Someone else comes over and puts down two Pepsi glasses. Then she walks over with two more. Looks like there is no communication here - or light fixtures.

Looking at the expansive menu, we decide to check Yelp on our phones for other reviewer's suggestions before ordering. We've done it before and it's worked. Unfortunately, this gets us a rude comment from a guy who is now our server (yep, we have now had three people ""serve"" us). He snaps at us, asking if we're texting or if we're ready. Well, excuse me, Mr. Sassy Pants. I was actually looking for what to order in this dump, if you don't mind. Not wanting to ruin what is supposed to be a fun experience, we politely order our meals. I get the chicken sandwich, he gets the roast beef au jus.

A whole HALF HOUR later, our magical sandwich creations come out from the kitchen. One look at these things, and you'd ask yourself, What the hell took so damn long? My sandwich was the most uninspired thing I've seen in a long time. It was a big slab of chicken breast thrown in between a hamburger bun, with an un-melted slice of American cheese, uncooked green peppers and a spoonful of grilled onions. Half of it tasted like chicken -- the other half tasted burnt and like an old oven. His sandwich was no better - but it came with burnt, hard and cold french fries that a dog would sneer its nose at. 

Needless to say, the food was terrible. I don't care about the ""large portions"" and ""everything is made on the premises"" bullsh** - this food is barely edible. Like I said, I get that this place has ""character"" and it's dirty on purpose which adds to its charm but I'm sorry, you aren't winning me over on that load of horse apples. Take your character and shove it where the sun don't shine - which just so happens to be the dark dining room at Big Jim's.",2011-08-16 05:12:35,0

The food was a brilliant complement to the beer; much of the food incorporates beer from their list in its preparations.  Notably, Bieres Et Compagnie offers a large range of preparations of mussel, as well as several gourmet burgers and other main dishes.

That's comparable to McDonald's pricing, and way more filling than Big Macs. 

I used to go to Yoshinoya a lot when I was in Asia. Kome's menu does remind me of Yoshinoya's, but way more choices. They even have Ramen. And I heard that they do their broth and flavoring in house, unlike many other Ramen places in the GTA, using packaged broth, so they all taste rather the same. 

I tried their Gyudon with scallions and Onsen Tamago. My partner ordered Curry Katsu. First, the taste. This is better than Yoshinoya's. Reminds me of some of the Gyudons I tried in Kyoto, Japan. The curry Katsu is great for the price. Same dish would cost 10-15 US dollars south of the border, and it's $9.99 Canadian. And the taste is so much like homemade Japanese Curry.

It comes with fried eggs, julienned cucumber, house made do chua (pickled carrot and daikon), shredded lettuce and crushed peanut. To make it spicy they bring you a side of house made chili sauce. Use a little of the nuoc cham ( sauce in the glass bottle) over your lettuce and mix it in with everything else after you've taken a few bites and as you eat.

The service here is nothing short of sad. When I entered the restaurant there was no hostess waiting to seat me. So I stood by the cash register trying to get the attention of the employees for about 5 minutes before I finally decided to seat myself. After 10 minutes a waiter finally comes over. I'm excited by the prospect of finally getting to order some 4 star food, so I ask the waiter to recommend a dish. Guess what? He speaks no English! I'm not trying to be insensitive but when your clientele is predominantly English speaking, I think its reasonable to expect that the waiter will be able to speak English as well! So I had to wait another ten minutes for an English speaking waitress who recommended the stir fry noodles as their best, most authentic dish.

After about 7 minutes my food comes out. Kudos on the speed, but the kudos end there. This was quite possibly the NASTIEST ""Vietnamese"" food I ever had. It was a mess of grease grease and more grease. The chicken and shrimp were so overcooked that I had to take a chewing break. I was disgusted and even though I am not Vietnamese I was insulted that they would call this catastrophe Vietnamese.

THERE are TOO MANY other RESTAURANTS out there with GREAT FOOD. The service, the attitudes of the servers and the manager at this location is appalling. My wife and I arrived at the counter at 8:30pm and were immediately told the restaurant closes at 9pm. I informed this extremely rude worker that 9pm was 30 minutes from then and he replied ""just need to let you know."" I said we were going to sit on the patio anyway and he replied ""we have problems with people wanting to sit out there for 2 hours"". I'm thinking, Okay, well whatever... You know when that little voice says ""LEAVE!"" ,... well, yeah, I ignored it. Boy was I sorry I dd. As if this wasn't bad enough, it gets worse!!  The food finally came (normally I wouldn't have worried about it ... but we were on a time clock!!) I asked for an extra plate so my wife and I could share one of the dishes, it literally took the guy 5 minutes to get it to us. At 8:45 they start dumping the ice tea after we asked him to please save the one tea my wife drinks and wanted to get one to go. I had to go in to ask again if they could save the tea. I noticed this woman with a gallon jug filling it up with ice tea and I asked if they were going to put that out so we can get refills from it... She looked at me and stated NO! This was for an employee who wanted to take home ice tea. (side note: hope the employee is paying for it!!)  Right about this time a HUGE group of about 10 people walked in and wanted to eat and this guy tells them, we're closing. Sorry!... The group said, ""I thought you were open until 9pm?"" And he said, ""well it's almost that time now, Sorry!"" UNBELIEVABLE!! At 8:50 this same guy and girl come out onto the patio and start stacking chairs REALLY LOUDLY and it seemed quite obvious at this point that they wanted us to pack up our food and leave!! I looked at my wife and stated I am staying here until 9pm and I'm going to enjoy my food and ignore the RUDENESS of these employees. When they were done stacking chairs and bringing them into the restaurant this NASTY GUY comes up to us and looks at our food & says ""Oh, looks like you still have some food left"" and started to walk away. (It was 8:58pm)... at this point I took the opportunity to let this young man know how rude he was being. How his attitude, words and behavior has made us extremely uncomfortable and will definitely make us NOT want to come there any more. At that point the woman walks over to us and identifies herself as the manager (WHAT?? REALLY??!!!)... and says, ""the owner makes us clock out at 9:30pm or we get in big trouble so we have to make people leave by 9pm."" I asked for the owners name or card as I want to speak with him about this ridiculous policy and it is basically running patrons off. She said he doesn't have a phone number, just an email address. And he's already received complaints about it, but doesn't care. I was shocked at this and want to leave a MESSAGE DIRECTLY TO THE OWNER!! If this truly is your policy I say to you, there are literally THOUSANDS of other places to eat and HUNDREDS of new restaurants opening up and begging for business. Although I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN, you will continually & constantly lose customers with this negative and offensive attitude and behavior...  your employees will not only NOT be clocking out by 9:30... they won't be clocking out at all, as you've run everyone from your business and your doors will close just like the last 10 restaurants in that same location has done before you.

My friends steak was to die for. I wasn't craving steak since it was 10pm but if I go there again, I will make sure I'm there earlier so I can order a steak. 

We started with the shrimp cocktail and it was delicious. The shrimps were huge and  scrumptious. I highly recommend that appetizer. It comes with three jumbo shrimps so if you have a bigger party, you may want to order a few. 

We also ordered a side of asparagus and mashed potatoes. The asparagus was really good!  I loved them. Unfortunately, I couldn't try the mashed potatoes because they had dairy in them but my friend said they were really good.

The food was terrible. Absolutely, undeniably, terrible. I would not have expected such an establishment to serve such mediocre food. I read a few negative yelp reviews but they were far and in between. I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. 

Those that praise this place's food, I am speechless. 

The pricing is RIDICULOUS. I love fine dining. I can, and am willing, to spend hundreds on meals as long as the price warrants the experience. 

This place, does not.

We were a group of 15 and we booked the Louis XIII Room. Also known as the famous ""room that Drake filmed his music video in"". Every single person of the 15 left unsatisfied and upset.

We pulled up to valet and went through the front doors to be greeted by... Noone. We waited and decided to walk through. Waiters zoomed by us without a greeting. We were confused. The ceilings were really really low. There were no windows. We felt like we were in a cruise ship, trapped. Finally we were able to find the hostess stand tucked away somewhere. 

We decided to get a drink at the bar. The cocktails ranged from $26 to $45 - These were more expensive than cocktails at Dbar at Four Seasons. The bar was a standard bar, that looked pretty much like what I had in the basement of my house, not a fancy well-stocked bar. Surprising that the bar would be this lacking and so, ordinary, for such an establishment.

We finished our cocktails (at least the were strong to numb the pain of terrible overpriced food) and as we were about to get up from our seats a waitress with a flaming baked Alaska yelled ""BEHIND YOU WATCH OUT"" as she ran past us. I feel like she could've waited and let us pass first, not like we are at a marketplace. Rude.

We made our way back down the nondescript stairs to the low-ceiling area i.e. basement where the Louis XIII Room turned out to be as well. It was a cramped room with a wooden table that was much too large for the size of the room. The chandeliers were modern in a tacky way. There were about thirty champagne flutes lined up on the far side of the wall and another thirty glasses behind me. I felt like I was in a random storage room of the restaurant. The glasses were there in the beginning, were unused, and left there for the whole night. 

Service was mediocre. We had only one waitress to serve all of us for the entire evening. 

I asked pricing for the market price items: Beluga Caviar was ($245) and the Kobe Beef Steak  was ($450). We traveled to Tokyo and had mouth watering Kobe Beef steak. We decided not to take the risk here.

Alcohol:
We ordered ordinary shots of Hennessy for the birthday girl. The were $40 each. The cheapest half bottle of red was $36 with the 2nd cheapest being $50 - some Tuscan Sangiovese blend. It was great because they didn't cook it! 

Appetizers:
Crab cakes ($22) to share for two, they plated it separately so we can each have one crab cake(!).   I asked them to go easy on the salt (based on Yelp reviews). They still came out salty. 

Ahi Tuna Tartare ($25) very bland. Not seasoned all the way through. Raw tuna was very chunky. Generous portion though.

Watermelon Salad - This salad made the whole table laugh. It was watermelon sprinkled with feta cheese (the same feta cheese left out on the table to eat with the bread). 

Mains:
Prime Rib ($52),  medium rare. The cut had so much cartilage my fingers were starting to spasm and hurt from trying to saw my way through the cartilage. The meat was bland. I couldn't swallow the pieces of cartilage - I left most of it untouched.

Bone in Rib Steak ($52). It was cut too thick and was overly charred on the outside that it gave a bitter aftertaste. Also left most of it untouched.

Sides:
Asparagus (half, $6.50). Tasted very ordinary 
Lobster Mashed Potatoes ($15) - tiny piece of lobster on top of mashed potatoes, the potatoes tasted like the mashed potato mix you can get at the supermarket
Roasted Cauliflower - This was probably the only dish that was gourmet. Had a strong taste of curry and was charred well. Over seasoned but memorable.

Sauce:
Foie Gras and Truffle au Jus ($3) - What an odd tasting sauce. It was kind of tangy and sweet with a strong molasses type flavour but maybe burnt? Not recommended. First, the lady set it down for the guest to the left of me so I told her it was mine. She looked at me, POINTED at the guest to my left and said ""NO ITS HIS"" then came back and said ""ITS ACTUALLY YOURS"".  I thought pointing was rude?

Dessert:
I don't remember, the food was so terrible I just drank more wine to numb myself so I can go home and lament over my $400 I just burn to a crisp.

Please, for the love of God, do not eat here. Go to Jacob's Steakhouse for your money or even The Keg.

For our appetizers, we ordered Calamari and Ahi Tuna Tartar. For our mains, we both ordered Filet Mignon with Mashed Potatoes and Broccolini on the side to share. We were expecting high quality food based on the reviews and the price for everything we ordered, but we were in for a surprise.

After placing our orders, the waiter came back in less than 5 minutes with the Calamari. We were surprised at how fast it came out because usually it should take at least 15 minutes to freshly prepare a new batch, especially at a high-end restaurant. The calamari wasn't hot, fresh or crispy. The texture was more on the soggy side, as if the calamari was sitting out and just reheated. Definitely a bad start to our meal. The Ahi Tuna Tartar was another terrible dish, worse than the calamari for sure. The Ahi Tuna was warm and the flavours of the sauce were just bad. 

Now for the Filet Mignon, we both ordered our steaks medium rare and the outer edges were fine but the center of the steak was too raw for us, and the outside crust of the steak was really dry and overcooked. One thing I noticed when eating my steak was that I tasted a lot of curry flavour. I'm not sure if the steak was meant to have a curry taste, but I definitely tasted it and it wasn't pleasant at all. No steak should be served with curry flavour unless it was stated directly on the menu.

We had a terrible dining experience at Harbour Sixty and we couldn't understand how this restaurant received many great reviews. Either the chef on duty was severely slacking that day or that this is the norm for the restaurant. We've been to several high-end restaurants and never have we experienced such distasteful food, especially the extra added curry flavour on the steak. It's extremely unbelievable at how much money we spent on poor quality food. I don't recommend this restaurant to anybody considering it because there are tons of steakhouses, such as Jacobs & Co Steakhouse, that offer top quality food at almost the same price.",2015-01-26 17:38:56,0

We had a 6:30PM reservation and when we called prior to the reservation to let them know one additional guest would be joining, we were told by the staff that they could accommodate but that we would have to be done by 7:45PM. I was in shock at that comment since A) the restaurant is an expensive one and I'd expect you to understand guests would want to take their time to enjoy that expensive experience and B) that's just not an appropriate thing to say to a customer. I ignored the comment from the hostess for both reasons mentioned above and shook it off prior to arriving.

Fast forward to dinner; I'm sitting at our table and the server greets me with ""I'm sorry you have to leave so soon!"" to which I replied... ""What do you mean? We have nothing scheduled for after dinner"" he said ""we have another party coming in here at 8"" (i.e. You people need to leave). 

The next hour and 15 minutes were about as enjoyable as a well done steak. I could sense we were being rushed by our server and the bus boys from the first course to the third... wait a minute... from the first course to the second since we weren't even offered coffee or dessert but presented with the check instead! I've never experienced treatment like this at ANY restaurant, let alone at one as upscale as this one. The $1,500 bill was not too shabby, so it was not as if we were taking up valuable space and splitting 3 side orders. We bought expensive wine, appetizers, salads, steaks and sides (not to mention a $120 lobster special that should have only been a lobster tail one of the guests asked for... something I could write a separate post about) so to be treated like that and rushed out in that manner was absolutely uncalled for. 

The food was good - I can't complain too much about that; but the service was so embarrassing (for both the restaurant and myself to be treated that way in front of my clients) that it has completely overshadowed any bite of that meal. The lobster (which they incorrectly ordered on our behalf and charged us for), was not good. Not at all. It wasn't worth $25.... And yet we were charged $120.

We were traveling from the U.S. on vacation and were looking forward to a good sweet wine such as a late-harvest Riesling or Canadian ice wine to celebrate our last day in Canada. There was a Riesling Alsace Cuvée Ste. Catherine 2001 for $22.50 per glass that I ordered under the recommendation of the waitress/sommelier that it was a ""very sweet"" wine from France. I specifically asked her about the wine because I was not familiar with Ste. Catherine. I asked her again if it was sweet because sweet Rieslings from Alsace are rare except the late harvests. It was definitely not a sweet wine. I explained this to the waitress and asked if she had tasted the wine. She insisted that she had and she stuck to her claim that is was very sweet. She was, in fact, offended by my question about whether she had tasted the wine. I have never gone to such a high-end wine bar with such an unprofessional waitress who argues with the customer without even tasting the wine to see if maybe something was wrong with it. Considering that they are charging $20+ for a bottle of wine that costs around $45-50 retail, it is even more ridiculous. And even if I were wrong, I would expect a little more deference because wine tasting is generally a subjective evaluation. Do not be enticed by their impressive wine list (some of their wines run in the thousands of dollars per bottle). They would probably not admit it even if one of their $10,000+ bottles of Pomerol or Romanee-Conti were corked. And, finally, to add insult to injury, they actually charged us for the $22.50 glass of alleged sweet wine.

My halibut was dried out, having sat under a heat lamp too long (the plate was hot!). My guests also didnt enjoy their meals. Although we indicated that we had waited over an hour for our main courses, no one apologized for the wait. The maître d'hôtel did not even check on us once even though he greeted and seated so many others (and we aren't talking about a huge restaurant here; maybe 50 people). Anyway, the restaurant was very busy. I hope that the other guests, who seemed to have gotten better treatment then my party, enjoyed their meal more than we did.  We went home and ordered thai.",2018-10-04 17:18:08,0

We assumed we just seat ourselves so we wandered around to find no tables. I immediately got frustrated as we sat along the back wall on two stools facing the wall. I felt like I was in time out or something while everyone behind us was having fun. 

    A server came over handed us two glasses and a bottle of water and asked ""do you plan to sit here?"" I replied unless there is a table open. He turned right around and pointed at one of their tables which had four people sitting there already but had two open seats and said, ""you got two right here."" I said umm aren't those people using it. He said ""no bud we have common area seating."" I laughed as I thought he was kidding but he wasn't. No offense but I don't need to share my table with someone I never met before. This was just as bad as the bench seating people put in their restaurants and you practically hear every word the people next to you say as they do yours.

I told the server we are good here, ordered our food and got out. Food was decent but after I laughed at the fact our server told us to sit with strangers I think he got offended and kind of ignored us, so service was flat out poor. I really felt like I was in timeout then, HA! Never again. I don't understand the concept nor do I want to. Think to yourself, if there are two different groups sitting at one table and one group leaves, do they clean that part of the table off or just remove the plates and not disinfect it? You then have others coming and sitting at a dirty table. And if they do clean it makes it pretty inconvenient for people who are still siting there.",2017-03-07 15:33:25,0

I suggested that as we were both starving and I had a pair of gift cards taking up space in my purse we should go to the Keg.  Finally.  I've had one gift card since probably 2005-2006.  We agreed and had an interesting time driving to Crowfoot (a perfectly sized Focus decided to block my view of his car so at one point I had no idea if I was going the right way)...

As it was a Saturday the movie theatre customers had taken up the vast majority of parking, but we managed to find a pair of spots between the Keg and the Chapters.   We went in and the wait was 30 minutes but we weren't in that big a hurry (really it ended up being more like 15-20).  First impressions were that we were seriously underdressed and I thought I should have kept my work shirt on as at least that was better suited to the upscale atmosphere than our jeans, gamer shirts, and hoodies.  Nobody treated us like we were out of place though and that was very much appreciated.  At the end of the meal our server even joked that we'd have been okay in PJ's (we would never do that though - I saw that once at Felicos in Richmond, BC and was completely appalled by the sight).

We were seated in a nice quiet back booth where we could hold a conversation without having to raise our voices, and proceeded to review the menu and winelist.  To start we shared a scallops and bacon appetizer and the complementary bread.  The bread came first and was so warm it was difficult to break pieces off without overheating fingertips, which is exactly how we like it.  The butter was perfectly whipped so that it just melted into all the fluffy pockets of the bread and tasted delicious.  The scallops and bacon were perfectly cooked.  Unlike the last time I had bacon-wrapped-scallops, the bacon wasn't overcooked which meant the scallops were tough.  The Keg did it perfectly - tender scallops with slightly crisped bacon and a great cocktail sauce dip.  Those disappeared fast.

With the main course we each had a glass of the Malbec, a flavourful smooth red with a hint of bite that worked perfectly with the steak.  For the meal we each ordered the 10oz Prime Rib special with crispy onions.  My side was a twice-baked potato and his was the garlic mash.  The prime rib was left as medium rare and was so close to rare that I was absolutely delighted.  I like mine pink throughout and the ring from the smoke, seasoning and baking was so think and perfect that the meat itself tasted just right.  The au jus was light and added a little bit of a different flavour but the juiciness wasn't needed due to how tender the meat was.  Honestly it was one of the best steaks I have ever had.  The crispy onions were delicious, and the twice baked potato was filled with sour cream, chives, and minced bacon - absolutely delicious.  I added a little au jus to the potato and that was really good too.

For dessert, because we saw the menu and just had to have some, D had his favourite - cheesecake with strawberry and a little chocolate sauce, and I had the creme brulee.  The cheesecake was light, rich in creamcheese flavour, and the crust was just the right amount.  I might try that next time - as one little taste definitely isn't enough.  The creme brulee was rich and creamy with a delicious simple flavour, and the topping was lovely though for my taste I usually prefer a few more seconds with the blowtorch as only a few spots cracked properly.

Our server was great, conversational and helpful.

All in all we followed each other home stuffed and content after our first really nice dinner out in the 6+ years we've been together.  For steaks like that, we will definitely be back!",2015-04-13 17:45:55,1

When this Keg first opened the food was exceptional. It seems every time I return the experience becomes less inviting. Tonight, after slow service, I finally received my sirloin Oscar. The steak portion was long and skinny, half grizzle. (Usually it's plump and round) The 2 shrimp were over cooked, hard, dry, and half the size they normally are. The 1 scallop was hard and tasteless. The vegetables were undercooked and tasted like old boiled water. The twice baked potato was cool, but good. After all it does have bacon in it. The sauce was barely a tablespoon spread on the meat. I think this was the most disappointing part. At least with ample sauce you can mask the other bland flavours. I am not one to complain so I half finished my meal. I did mention to the server that the steak was an odd shape and not very good. I can't remember a time when I left half my steak on the plate. The portion is small to begin with, so it had better all be good, not half grizzle. Especially for the price. I received a half sincere  apology and that was it.

It wasn't their fault but they seated us in a corner where it was dark and claustrophobic. The waitress wore so much perfume you could smell her down the street...not a good start. We asked for napkins and it took 20 minutes before my we got it. When asked for more complimentary bread, Erin (I think that was her name) our waitress acted like we were criminals and said there wasn't any more..Part of the draw for us was the delicious bread and great service...We were there as it was opening so it wasn't very busy, I was confused why it took our waitress so long to get us anything we asked for.  Then when our steak came we had ordered peppercorn sauce but it didn't come. When it did our steak was cold. One would think they charge extra for peppercorn sauce that it would at least be a significant amount and hot..none  of the above occurred....Worst meal experience ever. The claustrophobia got so bad I had to leave as I was becoming nauseas. My husband paid the bill as I ran out to the light...sadly what followed me was the stench of the waitresses super strong  perfume.

I love eating at Bellagio and definitely expect great food and service when I'm there, but wow, Lago is above and beyond.

You could never tell it just opened this week. Service was amazing! It's shared plates-style dining so the dishes are small but plenty, which is awesome because you get to try so many flavors. Our server was welcoming and explained the dishes and cocktails in great detail. 

Speaking of dishes and cocktails, OMG. Chef Serrano does an exceptional job adding exciting twists to Italian classics with five-star presentations. The ""7&7"" (lobster and gnocchi) is to die for, and the salmon and scallop crudo (served raw with lemon aioli and some blood orange awesomeness) are ridiculous! The cocktails paired well with the food and were presented unlike any way I've ever seen. My bellini even came with a gold-dusted raspberry.

Perhaps the best part of dinner was the atmosphere. Very lively and modern with great vibes. Floor-to-ceiling views of the Bellagio Fountains--just breathtaking! The only way to get closer is swimming in the lake...which you probably shouldn't do. :)",2015-04-15 05:22:22,1

We agreed to wait for a table with a view of the lake. Our hostess seated me while my husband cashed out at the bar. She told me we had a time limit on the table that is strictly enforced and expected me to agree to it before I sat down which I did not and deferred to my husband. He really had his heart set on trying Julian Serrano's food. The hostess told him that we had a finite amount of time at the table and walked away. Neither of us were pleased at the idea of spending hundreds of dollars for dinner and being rushed              through it. We then sat at the table for at least ten minutes without any server acknowledging that we were even there. During this time my husband went to Open Table a booked a reservation across the street at Giada's which has small plates and entrees of delicious Italian food. We had eaten there a few nights before and were blown away by how great the food and service was. On our way out we made a point of telling the manager what had happened at Lago and he said that they don't strictly enforce time limits on tables.

Went there for lunch with a colleague on Friday, I had the white premium tontaksu (prob spelt it wrong) and my friend had the black tontaksu. The broth was VERY flavourful and thick without being overly salty (yums). The pork was not as fatty as some other ramen places so that was nice. My ramen came with thin noodles which I liked and my friend's ramen came with thick noodles. Properly soft boiled eggs / seasoned eggs. We both enjoyed our ramen!

We also ordered the crispy chicken and it was super fresh. I'm guessing it's breaded in-house with their own seasoning and fried to order. Will definitely order again.

the taste is not too bad, BUT
- insanely MSG, you have to drink gallons of water after and still feel thirsty like your body is leaking
- among our bowls, some noodles are not done yet, still raw and hard in the middle, and noodles in different bowls are DIFFERENT! for my Cha Cha it is thick like a straw but in tonkotsu it is thin as thread, nothing is written on the menu, or did you just put in wrong ones by mistakes?
- we had it on a Sunday night, no alcohol involved and that was our last meal, some of us had a sleepless night afterwards and took a sick day today, the others? spent the rest of night in the washroom, oh, and the next morning.

Man, you have a serious problem with your food do you know that? it is not even about the quality.


the service were much more interesting:
1. the greeter at the door did not know how to do a waiting list and start panicing and look around for manager. srsly? gimme a pen and paper and everybody can show you. just the name and # of ppl?
2. when the waiter was at our table, his face is just WAY TOO CLOSE to customers, like if i blink the eye lashes will be on his face close. is it now popular for la bise in japanese restaurant? this is so awkward, and boy, you are just not cute enough to have the privilege.  
3. we asked for the bill, the waiter grabbed the manager, manager typed sth in the computer, and thats the end of story. then we waited for 20 min at least. and they were still swinging by like nothing happend? hello? the bill?
4. so finally we grabbed another guy, my original words are: can we have the bill please? we asked for it 20 mins ago. he looked at us, 5 second pause, and respond in Chinese: you want the bill right?  uuggh? why?? is your translator broken or what?

The service is marginal, you have to ask for everything explicitly, the food comes out in whatever order they feel like, the servers barely make eye contact, nevermind bothering to find out who ordered what. This leads to the food being placed willy nilly on the table, leaving the diners to move the food to the person who ordered it. What do I pay you for, again?

The food was pretty dismal, I knew that the dining experience would be disappointing when my army base stew, which comes in a earthenware pot, was not boiling. I took a sip to find that it was lukewarm...and sweet.

Everything on that table had a the same tangy sweet and sour flavour, on different vegetables and proteins.

The side dishes were also disappointing, with the kimchi being super fresh and not fermented at all.

Lastly, and most damningly, they screwed up the rice! The RICE! That gets made in a machine! They had clearly put too much water in the rice as all the structural integrity in the rice had been compromised and it was like eating large chunks of rice-flavoured clumps.",2014-05-21 19:37:44,0

The food was super salty.  I'm used to the saltiness of Korean food, after all it's this ethnic food all about, spicy, salty and hot.  But this time it's way too salty for us.  Pork bone soup was such an disappointment.  Meat was too tough to chew.  The potato wasn't even cooked through so it was still cold inside.

Worst of all, servers and owner were so unprofessional in dealing with questions/comments as if they didn't really care.  Hate the snobbish attitude.

My first underwhelming experience was at their basement location in Chinatown so going in I wasn't exactly too thrilled. However on this night the choice wasn't mine and on this night the weather was just too damn good to stay indoors. It's certainly a bittersweet moment to realize that these guys have the most inviting patio on the strip yet probably the worst Korean food nearby as well.

Where do I start? Is it that somehow tasteless fall-off-the-bone pork bone soup? Or that one dimensional (just spicy) broth? Maybe it's the mediocre frozen/fresh dumplings in that regrettable broth. No, it's not any of the above. Surprisingly it's the humble grain that feeds billions around the world; the lowly rice. The way the rice was cooked sent chills down my spine. It was so atrociously bastardize that even that women(I read about) who had just recovered from a 16 year hunger strike (god bless her) would politely decline this offering. Even the mice and cockroaches will probably go on a hunger strike of their own at the site of this. Our Asian ancestors are probably be rolling in their graves right about now.

Chef César has traveled extensively and was actually born and raised in Peru. He is fantastic. 

What to order? 

Feeling adventurous? Go with the anticucho (cows heart, or chicken heart). 

Less adventurous? The lomo saltado is wonderful- beef, French fries, vinegar, Peruvian spices, marinate, etc. 

No adventure at all (like my housemate)? Pollo a la brasa. Admittedly it's fantastic, it's rotisserie style, perfectly seasoned chicken, served with a side order of aji Amarillo (spicy sauce common to Peru).

First time we checked this place out on a Friday night when it first opened, and it as an absolute disaster. We waited to be seated forever even though the place was almost empty, the waitress did not know anything about the menu, had no idea what drinks were available, and was completely overwhelmed. Our food came out at different times (party of 6, and no one got to eat together), I ordered the half chicken and one of my friends did too... and they were both COMPLETELY F'IN RAW inside. I'm talking the plates were bloody and all. The waitress took it off our bill but the rest of the experience did not improve. Also, the food was so ridiculously overpriced. Almost ALL sort of understandable for a new restaurant, so I thought we'd give it another try mostly because we had a Groupon. 

Second visit was just about a week ago and NOTHING changed. We pulled up and thought the place was closed. We walked in and did not see anyone around. We waited for 5 or so minutes before some frantic guy ran out of the kitchen and finally seated us. He told us he was the waiter and cook. He served us water and left. We didn't see anyone else for about another 15 minutes... at this point I was ready to leave but I thought about the Groupon and that it needed to be used, so we stuck around. Finally, the owner walked in and came to our table. Turns out he was going to be our waiter. I know he was the owner because I have met him at their original location previously. He made it a point to tell us all of their food is fresh and made to order, and that they don't pre-make anything at all. He assured us we would love the food. We didn't mention our initial visit.

We placed our food orders right away. We tried to keep the dishes simple, especially after we looked at the menu and noticed the sky high prices. This shit was ridiculous. My sister ordered a $10 Caesar salad that was literally a couple of leaves of romaine lettuce and a side of french fries. My fiance ordered the ceviche. I ordered the half chicken again in hopes that it would be better this time. Owner claimed it was ""amazing"" and that I should order it and wait until it comes out so I can be amazed. I also ordered a glass of wine, and my sister got a vodka soda. He brought the glass of wine and everyone's food but mine. He proceeded to tell me that the half chicken will take ""a really long time to cook"" and asked if I wanted to wait, or order something else. Dude waited to tell me this WHILE bringing out everyone else's food. I changed my order and ordered french fries and the cordon blue. This shit was so bad, I had 2-3 bites and left the rest of it. Meanwhile, he never returned and we were assigned another waitress who was so lost, I felt bad even asking for anything else. 

We asked to pay and our bill came out somewhere around $70. With the Groupon, we ended up paying around $40. The waitress took my phone in the back and didn't come back with it for at least 5 minutes... weird.

When I noticed this place pop up all of a sudden on yelp I was pretty excited because of the 5 star ratings and wanted to see if it really lived up to the hype.

Ribs - This was not fall off the bone, super tender or juicy. It was quite tough to chew on and I thought it was the initial piece I took but when I tried another it was pretty much the same. 

Brisket - Brisket is by far my favorite BBQ meat, Papa Naps brisket was submerged in a juice which kept it moist. I'm not sure if I like that since it washes away the dry rub that was on it. The first piece I had was ok, a little too much fat on it but nothing really special. 

Pulled Pork - This is by far the best dish they had and the savior of the meal. Pork was insanely tender, juicy and EXTREMELY flavorful. I usually don't care much for pulled pork, but if they had a store I would just go in for this. The initial serving I took was just perfect the way it was but when I went back for seconds, it was way too salty. It might have been a mistake, but nonetheless it was very good. 

We ordered a few sides and tried their sauce, but nothing really worth mentioning.

After arriving, I informed the hostess that I wanted a table for one, and that I would be happy to sit at the bar since they were busy. She took my name, told me it would be 20 minutes, and directed me to the waiting area. I waited. After she began seating people who came in after me at the bar, I asked why I'd been passed over. She looked at her sheet and said I had accidentally been overlooked. She told me they would have me seated within 15 minutes. 

What?! I asked her if she was serious and she nodded dismissively.

Having no backup plan for dinner, I decided to wait it out. 20 minutes later, it happened again. A group that came in after me was seated. I asked if I'd been skipped again and her response was, ""It appears so.""

We were a party of 8 planning a nice evening out after hanging out. We decided on this restaurant because it had a good variety of foods. 

As we sat down, we saw the waitress was very friendly to the other table and immediately when she came over to our table she was not. We noticed the waitress was not welcoming at all. She was not friendly or engaging. People want to be blind when it comes to race, but people have underlying prejudices. 

As we were ordering, we were a little unsure about our orders being that it was our 1st visit there. The waitress she was impatient and her demeanor was very rude. One of our friends asked about the fries (quantity) since it was $4.99; she rudely replied with an attitude, ""It's a good portion."" Then his wife said to just give her water because the lemonade didn't taste like lemonade. She took the glass from her and walked away and threw it (in a pissed off manner) into a dishwasher bucket. When she returned, I asked her if we could have someone else serve us because it seemed that she had an attitude with us. Instead of her saying, yes no problem, she began arguing with me about her attitude. She stormed off and our group decided this was not where we wanted to patronage. 

Once outside, we stood there for about 10mins deciding where we were going to go and no one came out to ask us what happened. This life is so surreal.

We were not greeted by anyone at our table for quite some time. Once we were greeted the server took our drink orders and went on. The server stated the reason for the delay in service was due to a staff snafu in the kitchen causing confusion amongst the menu and the servers (???). We then saw the servers and bussers casually talking while we were awaiting our drinks. We finally got our drinks after what seemed like quite some time with the exception of my drink, which did not arrive. After two more trips by a busser and the server, it did not dawn on them that I was missing a drink causing me to ask again. We then ordered our food. The rolls served are standard dinner rolls you buy by the bag from the grocery store. They weren't heated or even accentuated. Just plain rolls. The mozzarella sticks were clearly frozen beforehand. Grocery store, boxed quality, which is baffling because they are so simple to make in a well stocked kitchen. Two turkey sandwiches were ordered, which both diners complained that the turkey tasted of grocery store packaged quality. My wife ordered chicken strips and fries (safe,right?), which are breaded oddly with breadcrumbs tasting of thanksgiving stuffing. Just a very odd flavor and very dry. My grandfather-in-law ordered the all you can eat fish and chips. He, being a longtime favorite of the restaurant, felt the need to apologize to us because he found his meal subpar. My food was horrendous. Started off with a cup of clam chowder, very bland and not true clam chowder whatsoever. Should be revised if not removed from the menu entirely. On to the main meal, the mashed potatoes were old. It was easy to tell they had been sitting for quite some time before serving. The chicken fried chicken was absolutely dreadful. It was over cooked, dry, and tasted as if it had been previously frozen and reheated. Fresh fried chicken tends to be juicy with oil residue within the breading. This was not the case. It was dry and tough. A fork should easily slice through a fresh chicken breast. It did not. The gravy was powdered gravy, not freshly made. I wish I could've washed the dry food down with a drink, but a refill needed to be requested a couple times. When asked by the server how the food was, we all kind of moaned and groaned without saying it blatantly sucked. The server nervously laughed and just said ""great! Is there anything else I can get you?"". Um, we all voiced displeasure, why would we want anything else? Lastly, the manager was notified of these issues. She seemed just as confused as we were as diners. When told about the chicken fried chicken, she proceeded to tell me they did not serve chicken fried chicken. She then realized the meal I was referring to and blatantly said ""that's not real fried chicken"" and nervously laughed. Um, what? Yeah I could tell.

Sat down and was never asked if i wanted anything to drink so I ordered a roll. So finally fed up I asked the sushi chef for some water.

My first roll was the Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll it was mediocre at best the tuna was very mushy. Then orderd fried tofu which was ok, and also ordered the yellowtail which was ok, spicy tuna which again mushy and the california roll which was ok

waiter gave me the check while I was still eating didnt ask If i wanted anything else (not like I would of ordered anything else after all the dissapoinments) Had to ask for a water refill otherwise they would have dried me out! Left most of what I ordered at the table.

I was asked if everything was ok by 4 different people 8 times I dont know if thats good or bad! Didnt feel comfortable,felt rushed and I just wanted to leave.

So after all the dissapointments I had to cheer up somehow so I went across the street for a sure thing got some mango crepes which made my night!

unfortunately, i have little to nothing good to say.

first off, the ambiance is not pleasant.
sushi making is such a precise and delicate art that i feel that the restaurant that serves this type of delicacy should reflect that as well.
kaze's music selection is hard and loud so i picture the chefs making their sushi with hammers and mallets.
it was difficult for me to enjoy myself as i felt i was being attacked by their music selection.
this should typically not be something to mention at a restaurant but it was just THAT bad.

although they provide an ayce menu of sashimi at the sushi bar, i would dare not partake as the pieces of fish that i had were less than fresh and all had a very odd taste. 
they were also all cut improperly, with no precision nor consistency.

now for the sushi rice.
proper sushi rice can make or break a piece of sushi.
the rice here at kaze was undercooked, had no vinegar flavor, no umami.
each piece of sushi that i attempted to pick up simply fell apart because the rice was not sticky.
it also didn't help that each piece was drowned in some sort of sauce.
what i've learned from my sushi experiences is that a restaurant that drowns its fish in sauce, does not serve fresh fish as they are using the sauce to cover up the fishy flavor.

i won't be returning since there are plenty of other places that serve fresher, better quality items.",2013-03-06 02:56:24,0

The pho (#34) here is overpriced ($13-$15 for a bowl? Ridiculous), over seasoned, and over done. The broth was way too salty and the meat was very tough and hard to chew. Their ""large"" portion was, at best, a small at any other pho place I've been to.

The pad thai was also horrendous. The noodles were very gooey and the sauce was overly sweet. There was also a very strange fishy flavor and odor coming out of it. Sweet and sour sauce + over done rice noodles does not make pad thai.

Lastly, the banh mi. I decided to give the sandwich a try, because hey, they can't screw up a simple sandwich as badly as the other two dishes I tried right? Wrong.

Oh boy.... the meat. It consisted of three kinds of packaged deli meats (pictures uploaded) that I'm guessing they bought from the Giant Eagle right behind the restaurant. Is it really that hard to marinate and grill pork?

I remember seeing people line up in droves at the Baldwin location and thinking, what's all the fuss about this ....kinton ramen? (trying to read the sign) But Ramen is indeed something the get excited about and I learned that when I tried it out last night!

First of all the service is exceptionally friendly, the servers are always one step ahead of you and just really pleasant. Don't come here if you're looking for a relaxed atmosphere, you're only here to eat ramen (and I don't mean that in a bad way  :P).

I ordered the miso ramen with chicken breast, 2 other of my friends ordered spicy pork, and the other two ordered miso chicken and shoyu pork. 

So ramen is amazing, the way they make the broth I have no idea but it's liquid perfection and I could eat it forever; but despite my wish the bowl does in fact end and all you are left with is pure satisfaction while also wondering what bowl you'll order next time (I have my eye on the spicy pork). 
Every component was great, chicken cooked perfectly, noodles perfect, broth amazing, and it's so fun to eat! The perfect canvas for flavour. No wonder all the success.

One of our drinks came with a clipped finger nail in it.  YES THIS IS TRUE.  Our server was shown the nail, seemed stunned as to what to do and just stood there.  My friend had to actually say she did not want this drink.  The server then took the drink but left the nasty nail clipping on our table.  NO APOLOGY GIVEN.
If that wasn't gross enough, my soup came with a lovely long hair poking out of the bowl.  As the server went to pass the bowl to me, I pointed it out, the server then pulled the hair out of the soup and continued to pass me the bowl.  AGAIN NO APOLOGY GIVEN.

Ok I'll have to admit I'm a big fan of the Black Tonkotsu at Sansotei so that's what I was judging this on. The broth lacked any real porkyness flavour. It tasted more like salty water.

I was in the area with my boyfriend and we always go to this shopping center for the yogurt and we always pass Ra. I guess I couldn't remember just WHY I block Ra out of my mind until it slipped and I decided to give it another shot.

Bad idea.

It was a very very slow lunch, so when we walked in we were surprised to see no one at the host stand. We waited for a few minutes and finally a manager appeared to seat us. Our server appeared shortly after we were sat. I don't even remember her name, but she wasn't bad at all. She was probably the best thing about the whole experience - but that's not saying much.

Anyway, my boyfriend ordered the beef teriyaki lunch but he wasn't a huge fan. I didn't try it so I can't say much else about it. I ordered freshwater eel nigiri - hard to mess up, spicy tuna roll - also hard to mess up, but it was also nothing special - and a softshell crab roll. I was definitely not a fan. The roll had too many other things in it that contradicted the crab - I ended up taking out the carrots and asparagus - too hard to put in a sushi roll! I was so put off by the roll that I didn't even finish it. It was a pretty expensive roll that should have just been kept simple like all other sushi places. 

For dessert, we ordered the banana maki. Again, it was nothing too special. Overall, I wasn't impressed and was reminded why I stayed away from Ra.

Probably about as far as sushi was the first time I tried that. But I was here with friends that knew the scoop (pun) so it was a great and delicious learning experience.

The odd thing is that there's no silverware. The food is served on a bigger-than-the-plate tortilla sort of bread. The object is to tear off pieces and scoop up the food. It's interesting, but again, no more different than eating with chopsticks.

With the Meskerem combo (a meat-oriented plate, but they have a veggie combo too), I had the opportunity to try a few different tastes. All of them were full of spices and vegetables that made for some great textures and flavors. I enjoyed it thoroughly and left stuffed.

They do have a limited (and rather inexpensive) beer selection. The usual domestics and imports available anywhere for $2.50 or $3.00. The water glasses were also kept filled.

An excellent meal and I would recommend it thoroughly, especially if you're looking to try something different. Yum!",2009-11-23 17:18:52,1

We usually order the Meskerem Combo, which is a combination of Tibs Wat (Beef sauteed with berbere), Gomen Besiga (Prime beef seasoned with garlic, onions and ginger, finished with collard greens), Miser Alicha (Split lentils with ginger, garlic, onions, olive oil and curry), and Miser wat (Red lentils).

We also order the Vegetarian combo... which is their cabbage dish, green bean dish, collards, and lentils.

This is plenty of food for 2 people, and we usually have leftovers!

Last time we got the Kitfo also, raw prime beef, chopped and mixed with spices and butter. It was delicious... but very spicy!!! I would compare it to steak tartar... except much more seasoned!

They also serve tej, which is honey wine they make in house. It has a very distinctive flavor, unlike anything I've had before, but lovely. It's not on the menu, but they have it for special request!

I had questions about the menu since this was my first experience with this type of cuisine and he seemed bothered by the fact I was asking questions. Seeing that I was getting nowhere with him, I chose chicken since I felt rushed to make a decision. It took almost 30 minutes for our meals to come out even though there were only two other tables occupied at prime lunch time (noon). Once our food arrived, the waiter never came back to check on us. We had to hunt him down for our check and when we received it, all of our orders were lumped together in one sum. I asked if we could pay individually for what we had and he refused. He split the $75 four ways and I ended up paying $18.75 for a handful of chicken and a can of warm Coke. (Oh by the way, they charge you for the baskets of bread you use to eat the food) Not happy with the experience, I only tipped $2 for a total of $20.75. When I checked my online statement a couple of days later, he had gone in and added more money to my tip !!! SO SHADY and ILLEGAL !!

The other day I was craving Ethiopian food...it's my weird comfort food...something with eating with my hands. Although I remembered my last visit here to be less than great, I thought I would test my luck. Call me unlucky.

It was one of those hot Charlotte days that reached almost 100, if not 100. We asked the owner if their A/C was broken and she quickly agreed that it was. My gut feeling was that they just didn't have it on high enough (since when we've gone in the past it wasn't really cool either). But I'll give her the benefit of the doubt, although she had been dishonest with us in the past (see last review).

Like others have mentioned, it is very slow service. She took our food order and our drinks didn't arrive (which we only wanted ice water to help beat the heat) until after she gave us our food order! And if you are familiar with Ethiopian food, some of the dishes have some spice...water is essential. 

The quality in food has definitely gone down. The lentil dishes are no longer meshed in a healthy clump, but now are a tad on the drizzly side. The cabbage dish was way overcooked. Lastly, they no longer have the dish that looks like a variation of couscous (which I know it wasn't, it just looked like that) and in its place is another runny lentil puree. They also stopped giving an entire injera bread and now have slices of it on a plate that equal half of one whole one. However, the one thing that has remained the same are the prices. Not worth it.

Veterans Day holiday so everyplace was packed.   McDonalds packed, Peter Piper pizza packed with waits over 1 hour for the buffet.  My son was dying to eat something so walking through the parking lot we saw Jimmy John's.  EMPTY.   First clue right.  hahahahaha

Anyway I said screw it since I never been to Jimmy Johns before.   We go inside and my son wants a meatball sandwich.  They say.  Nope no meatball.   I mean WTF.   Who the fuck doesn't have a meatball sandwich.  Then he very smugly directs me to a ham sandwich and says they are practically the same thing.   I was thinking bro what fucking planet are you from?  They aren't even close.  I said fine just give me a roast beef and some other unmemorable sandwich.   He said do you want combos.  I said sure then it came out to over 20 bucks for 2 fucking combos.  I only had a 20 dollar bill on me.  I was like forget the combos.  Just give me the 2 sammys and water.  Boom over 15 bucks....    Yeah no joke for 2 small ass sammys.  I was thinking wtf am I in NYC or something.  This is a fast food chain.  Give me a break.   Oh wait it gets better.   So the sammys come flying out really fast.    Then when I open them up I understand why they are fast.   There is barely just meat, mayo and cheese on the sammys.  No wonder they are fast.  There isn't any toppings on the damn things.  

So we sit down to enjoy our 15 dollar bare dry tasteless sammys, with 2 glasses of water.    I finally can't take it anymore and walk over to the worker and say can I get some Jalapenos to put on my sandwich.  He says no.  Then the manager comes over and says they can't give me sides because it is against corporate policy.    I said come on a couple of jalapenos nobody gives a shit.  She then says with a condescending attitude that corporate watches the cameras and she doesn't want to break policy.   I am not fucking joking.  Like corporate has better shit to do then to monitor cameras to see if a few jalapenos get snuck in on over priced fucking sandwiches.   I said what about that fresh ass tattoo that you got on your forearm that is dripping ooze all over the food?  Is that against corporate policy I say.

I usually start with the Beauty School Dropout (gin, lychee, lime, and grapefruit).... Yum! 

I then have an internal battle over whether to order the wings or fries. These are some of the best wings I've ever had and I love the kimchi ranch they come with. The satsuma fries (kind of similar to sweet potato fries) are thick-cut and served with a delicious gochujang aioli. Both come out quickly and are served nice and hot. The buns are also delicious but I usually gravitate toward the other options. Ordering an appetizer isn't necessary because the portion of ramen is very generous but it's nice to share.

For ramen, I'm loyal to the OG Morris but I like to substitute short rib for the pork belly. Both are delicious but the short rib is less fatty and seems to go well with the broth. The broth is rich and primal and perfect for a winter day.

Dear Morris Ramen,

I came to you on the afternoon of 9/8/17 with a slip of paper that held my full name, card number, and expiration date. Knowing you do not take reservations, after speaking with the host, I explained and wrote down the 3 customers who would be coming in at 7pm and that I would like to pay for their first round of drinks. (Written on paper with bank and customer info given to host.)

I arrive at 7pm with said guests. Table is sat, I order a round of sake. I am short on time and have to leave my guests before they are done eating. While still at the table, a server quickly drops off the slip of paper which I gave to the host earlier in the day with my card info on it. I ask the busied server ""is this taken care of?"" She says ""yes"".  
Later I receive a text from my friend that she had to pay for the sake I promised to have earlier taken care of. My friend says to me ""they said they don't do that"". 

It has been 30 minutes past with me calling your business number to discuss this matter and to offer my guests dessert as well as a fixed payment, and unfortunately, no answer. 

I am very dissatisfied with this. I stated clearly to the host with my name and phone number as well card info to apply to the check and to give me a call if there was any problems.

The wait for our dessert was also very long not sure if she forgot to pick it up but even the desserts were not good, I especially went to try the churros but they were too dry for my liking and my boyfriends dessert was tiny and tasteless. Sorry not even worth a $35 winterlicious menu. Our server didn't seem very pleased to be working and was very unfriendly. We also noticed that we got charged $1 more on all our beers then what was written in the menu, we didn't say anything we just replaced it with her tip.

- Appetizers were tiny and mediocre. We ordered queso and they brought us four small tortillas for six people. I don't know what they were thinking. Also, we got about six chips for an order of guac to share. WAYYYY too small portions for a Mexican place.

- Drinks (margaritas) were badly mixed - too tart!

- They messed up our order and brought us an extra plate of tacos and tried to charge us for it. When we talked to the manager, she removed the extra tacos from our bill but was incredibly snooty about it, as if she had done us a huge favor! The misorder was their fault!

We've been coming here for almost 4 years and it seems that they have changed the menu in the past few months.  We went last night (in Feb and the menu reads ""December menu"") and they have moved over to tapas style so smaller portions.  However, the prices have not changed.  It's just overpriced given the neighbourhood.  $11 for a small portion of guacamole and not enough chips!?  Very disappointing.

Overall the food was tasty but the service was PITIFUL.  By the time it came around for dessert (which we would have normally had), we just wanted to get out of there so we got ice cream instead.  We had reservations for 8pm and we were 2 couples.  We sat down and the server came to take our order immediately.  We didn't even have a chance to look at the menu.  She came back twice more in the next 10 minutes and we were just getting settled.  After all, it was Saturday night and were were planning to have a leisurely meal so we weren't in a rush.

They used to give you chips and salsa complimentary when you came in but now they charge you for it.  We were almost done the guacamole and the server came to take it away.  We told her that it wasn't done and to please leave it.  For $11 for a small portion, ya, we're going to finish it, thanks.

Before we were done our main course (approx 9:15), she brought over dessert menus.  It was just rude.  We would have said something but our server was the manager!  

Note - their kitchen closes at 9pm on a Saturday night.  So in some ways, they try to be like a downtown restaurant located midtown but really, they should just accept their location and price accordingly.

My boyfriend and I have been craving Japanese tapas since we came back from Tokyo and this place looked great based on reviews. Wow were we wrong, I'm appalled by the service at Kyara. 

We sat down and ordered our food, waited for 30 min and all that we got was miso soup. After waiting more they brought us half of our food. I noticed that we were the only  table that was given cheap wooden takeout chopsticks, after asking for the kind of chopsticks that the rest of tables had because they were better quality and not so flimsy, the waitress just brought me another pair of cheap ones. So we had to ask again! 
 
Now our miso soup is supposed to come with rice which they forgot, so I asked for the rice we ordered and the waitress looked at me like I was crazy and only brought me one rice even though I asked for two for the second time. 

So since we only got half of our meal and our rice came very late we still were trying to stay positive because the food did taste great. Unfortunately, this was not the last of our problems. So we waited and waited and waited for the rest of our food to come out and no one even came to check up on us until I had to flag someone down. I asked if the rest of our food was coming and the waiter looked confused. Yeah apparently they just forgot. Wow that was the last straw, I am a very patient and understanding person and I was very upset with the way my boyfriend and I were treated here. 

The cherry on top was that it was not even busy and the other table next to us who came in after us got all of their food and were happy as clams.

I had the don, beef tongue, and kimchi.  The beef tongue was good but the pork belly was alright.  

Now for service, it was terrible.  There wasnt much people even here and everything took forever.  We got the Miso soup last because our server forgot about it.  We waited literally an hour for it and for the rest probably 45 minutes. The table next to us ordered as we were waiting but got their food right away which I dont understand how and why. Probably because one of the girls was a coworker.  They got great service and our server was attentive to them.  I also didnt know that employees could drink alcohol while working.  Maybe thats why we got lame service.  The table next to us was also very obnoxious.  They kept yelling for the server because they were so drunk.

only minor comment, we felt that the wine list had only imported italian bottles and were all very highly priced! bottles at $500-600 should not even be on menu, imo...this is not las vegas! would be great if they offered some local ontario wine as well or at the very least ""house wine"" selection"" at more affordable rates. even a beet bottle at $7 is a stretch when the next door has happy hour special $4 bottles.

Regardless, it was worth the wait. I've been to Italy twice, and this is the only Italian restaurant I've been to in North America that delivers a similar experience to typical dining in Italy. Cured meats platter, cheese and olives were very typical of Italy, and delicious. One of the traditional dishes in Tuscany and north is Rustichelle al Cinghiale - or wild boar ragu over pasta. They had it on the menu at Paganelli's, and I asked the waiter about it - he recommended it and added that they (restaurant owners) raise the boar themselves to supply the restaurant. Now wild boar may sound odd, but having had the dish in Italy and loved it, I was up for trying it here. All I can say is, you have to try it.

They did comp us our bill because my girlfriend felt sick but the way the way the waiter accepted the unwanted guest was shocking.

Found out afterwards that they have recently been taken over by a people who are not Italian so ignore the quaint story in the menu about Italian ownership.

Let's begin with the drinks, appetizer and desserts drink. 

My nephew order the coffee green  milk tea. I got the Che Thai dessert and a fountain drink. My Che  Thai  was pretty good and the price was reasonable for what goes in. Fountain drink was over priced for the size of the cup.$2. My nephew however did not like his drink, nor did I. It taste like it was water down Coffee and no milk tea flavor. The eggroll seem kinda salt and really no flavor. I have had better ones. The eggrolls do have taro, which is similar to potatoes. We also go the summer rolls but no flavor in the meat that they use. 

Now let get to the real reason we came, the banh mi. They have some interesting banh mi. So we all order different ones and shared them. We got the Korean, Philly cheese steak, and  the banh mi buger. I have to say the cheese steak and the banh mi buger were pretty good and was season well, while the Korean  needed a little more flavor. I was sad that the korean didn't come with Kimchi. But all in all the banh mi is good.

 They are still new so hopefully once they get the hang of it everything will get better.

They've always offered me the best service and have never messed up on an order. Their drinks are good and their ticket times don't take any longer than 10 minutes IF that. 
My only issue is that I had eaten there twice before and both times ordered their Lemon Zest Tofu sandwich; being vegan that was my only option so I ordered it and had them hold the aioli(butter sauce). *there was nothing on the menu that said they did anything to their tofu, so I assumed it was just normal tofu*

After a month or so of not having been to the little shop, I go in to order my sandwich. I end up having a conversation with the cashier who then informs me that their tofu isn't vegan and is actually marinated in oyster sauce.

The menu is a collection of hearty and delicate dishes seemingly very well executed and served by the most wonderful staff imaginable. 
I enjoyed Polenta fries with an onion compote that was a brilliant blend of crisp yet fluffy polenta logs and the sweet and tangy onions with a cracked peppercorn like nothing you've ever tasted before. 
I ordered a pork shank from the special menu with mashed potatoes and a sautéed red cabbage. This dish was unbelievable perfection. The pork shank was tender yet firm and fell apart and melted in your mouth. To combine it with the sharp cabbage reminded me of actually eating in a country farm house.

First, we acknowledge that we were there for a while for our reservations, and I understand the issue, but the execution from the manager/owner was extremely unprofessional. The bathrooms were flooded from the hard rain while we were there and you could hear it from the table where we were sitting.  Because of this, there was a wait to go to the bathroom while the staff cleaned up and dried the area.  We were asked to leave as soon as we got our checks by the owner who came over and very rudely told us we need to leave because the next reservation would be there soon.  She gave all of us a dirty scowl several times. That is not how you should treat your customers after we spent over $400 dollars and we were waiting to use the bathroom due to the bathroom flooding. I suggest for the owner to treat her customers with more respect and less barbarous looks.  A much better approach would be 1) not directly offer dessert, and only offer if we asked or 2) say something along the lines of ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but another party is due to arrive shortly.

It lacked meat peices and just didn't taste good. 
They need to learn how to cook authentic Kothu Roti from Gasa Food located in Markham. Gasa has the best Kothu ever, the portions are large enough for more than two people and they only charge $6.50. The kitchen looked very dirty. I wanted to try this place ever since I seen it on Narcity. 
I also bought mutton rolls, which were typically only potatoes. There was probably only two mutton pieces in the entire roll. They also charged me $2 for a roll.
If you are looking to try good rolls, Hopper Hut in scarborough is the best place. $1 for each roll filled with tons of meat pieces.

Yes, the buffet was small but it still had a good 18 or so items. Not everything is going to be a Chinese or American food super buffet and it doesn't need to be. Each one of their dishes was so tasteful and scrumptious, it was nice that you could keep going back for more.

Would have been nice if they put a note on their website stating that they stop selling pizza by the slice at a certain time.  If I wanted a whole pie I would have driven the 5 minutes to blaze versus 20 minutes for a slice that I ultimately could not get from a place known for selling pizza by the slice.

More than likely I won't go back to try it",2018-08-12 01:38:28,0

Food was quick and mostly good (Alfredo was really good!) with one major exception - ordered a Greek salad with no olives due to a major allergy. Got the salad with olives! Sent it back and got a 'new' salad which had...olives but not as obvious or visible. Since all the other food had arrived thought maybe setting it on the edge of the table not touched would draw attention of the employees standing 4 feet away but deciding what to put on the tv was more important.

My husband went in to pick up the order at 2:45 with one other table in the restaurant. For a brand new location, you would think the staff would be excited for the opening and especially on National Pizza Day. Instead there was another woman in front who was asking for her slice. It was a standard cheese slice and the same woman at the register couldn't even remember. The owner came up and again didn't greet anyone just quickly threw a slice from another pizza together. No wow factor at all. When asked for parm to go they have no options. We get home pizza looks good. We both eat a slice saving the pizza for dinner and we both ended up with stomach aches. We gave it the benefit of doubt and went for another slice hours later- same result. We threw the rest away. We want to like it but it was basic and not worth the tummy ache.",2018-02-10 12:28:31,0

First of all, my wife and I had trouble finding the restaurant because there are no signs outside. The only signs are in the lobby of The Graduate hotel, where the restaurant is located.

Our server, God bless her, she was very nice, but we had to ask for silverware and napkins after we were eating the terrible cheese curds.

Btw the cheese curds are terrible. They taste like balls of those store bought frozen breaded mozzarella sticks. And the dipping sauce was essentially just ranch dressing. This was disappointing, since we were in Wisconsin after all.

I ordered the $24.00 steak (what was I even expecting ordering a steak for that low price...) and it came with asparagus and duck fat fingerling potatoes. The steak was....edible...it was fine, nothing I couldn't make myself at home. The asparagus was huge, kind of gross looking. It wasn't tender. The fingerling potatoes were flavorless and soaked in some sort of saturated fat that was certainly not duck fat. The worst part of the dish was that everything was topped with this nasty green pesto-like substance that vaguely had a garlic citrus flavor. Also, everything was sitting in a pool of the oily substance that the fingerling potatoes died in. 

I felt terrible for my wife cause she couldn't even really eat her burger. Said it tasted like McDonalds. I had a fry, it was like a deep fried store bought frozen crinkle cut.

Everyone at this restaurant was a college student except one other middle aged couple. Being in a building called The Graduate, my guess is that this place is run by college students, for college students since my dinner was maybe one step up from a dorm room dinner served on a paper plate.",2017-04-25 20:56:44,0

Waitress came with new glass of wine in clean cup this time and a beet salad. Problem: I ordered the caprese salad. When I told her I didn't order the beet salad she didn't have a response and just stood there and looked at me and finally said she could bring the caprese.

And the food and drinks are very good. But the service seemed aimed at trying to convince us never to come back.

Our server was unaccommodating and very slow. A table with empty drinks shouldn't sit unattended to for 20+ minutes. We sat outside but were asked/told by a professional photographer to move our table so they could take shots of us eating and drinking. I assume these were promotional shots for the restaurant, which I think is rude of the management to allow. We weren't offered a thanks or apology by the management for inconvenience. 

Shortly after, a round of drinks was spilled on us by the waiter. He apologized and partly cleaned up the mess. I don't think anyone should feel entitled to comped items, but by not comping us for the round, the Madison Blind gave us a good indication that they really didn't care what we thought of their restaurant. To top it all off, we were handed a bill from another table at the end of the night which resulted in 10+ minutes of confusion and corrections.

Any one of these incidents happens from time to time. Sometimes drinks get spilled. Sometimes you bring the wrong check. Sometimes you forget about a table. OK. But it was the consistent string of mishaps and the lack of interest in management in attempting to make up for them that really made for a memorably bad experience.",2015-09-16 03:11:03,0

Le Select Bistro feels a little bit off the beaten path as it's hidden away down the ""quiet-ish"" side of Wellington street (east of Spadina). They have a lovely tree-lined patio and a fairly spacious interior. 

They have some amazing tables at the back which fit two people in a half-circle shaped booth with a small round table. Very intimate and absolutely perfect for a romantic date.

The menu had every single one of my favourite French dishes and it was hard choosing just one. I ended up picking the Boullabaisse, which is a soup with mixed seafood. It had a really delicious tomato-based broth which was different than when I've normally had this dish, but it was a nice change. It came topped with rouille (mayo based sauce) on toasted bread slices. A perfect dish.

The wine list at this place is somewhat ridiculous; so big that it even has an index page at the beginning. Apparently they also have a corkage fee of $18 if you BYOW, which seems quite reasonable.

They have a prix fixe but the options were very limited (choice of 2 apps, 2 mains).

 What we demolished:

*  Shrimp Tempura - Not my fav.  It had a bit of a weird taste.  Nonetheless still good.
*  Shumai - these were deep fried and were heavy.
*  Yum Yum Roll -  Yum Yum indeed!
*  Sugar Dad Roll -  I accidentally ordered this, but it was good!
* Spider Roll - a classic favorite.  How can you mess this one up?
* Sake Nigiri -  The freshest fish in town.  Seriously it was amazing!!!!!
* Harry Potter Roll - Very vinegary in taste.  Jade and I were not impressed.
* Pacific Roll -  Coconut and Sushi.. whaaaa??  I definitely will order this again!

Pros:
 *  They had a few interesting specialty rolls (such as the Pacific Roll). Plus!
 *  Very clean interior and friendly staff
 * Stamp card available !
 * Seriously the freshest Salmon!  Thick cut and Fresh!
 *  I loved their presentation & how they combine numerous orders on 1 plate.

Cons:
 *  Parking can be a pain.
 *  Harry Potter Roll & Shumai in my opinion were a no go.

Overall:
  This place could have given me super crappy service and have overcharge me on AYCE,  but serving me Sake Nigiri of this quality would still give them a 5 star!  I'm really picky with my Sake Nigiri (my fav) and seriously this place had the freshest I have ever tried! Jade and I are pretty big fans of Sushi and I think I can speak for the both of us by saying we definitely recommend this place to others.

Tips:

We went into full pig-out mode as the first round of sushi was terrific, in our dizzy enthusiasm we accidentally ordered 2 more additional rolls when we still had 2 more coming.  Yes it was pleasure and pain mixed together just like Thanksgiving.  And yes as true sushi slut the Japanese lasagna roll was beyond taste euphoria!

Not only do you get all you can eat sushi with a great selection but you also get a large warm sake.  But be aware of the rules, you have 1 hour to consume your sushi and be careful not to order to much because you have to pay for what is leftover.

I have been to many sushi locations in the past and this is hands down the worst. The way I found out about this place is through yelp, but was mislead by how many stars they should really have. 

First off, the fish was of poor quality and definitely not fresh, according to sushi standards. Buffet Asia would of satisfied me a lot more than this place, that's how bad this place is. There rolls were devoid of any delicious flavor, due to the high usage of rice and stall fish.
 
Secondly, the big Asian guy who was our server, looked pissed off at us the whole time. I just don't understand why it's hard for servers to be that way and complain why we don't tip them as well as they wanted. That is how the cookie crumbles in America, bad service equals bad tips.

Going to various sushi spots in Vegas and California in the past, and eating at Inwhacka, it has given me a higher appreciation of what real sushi should be like. All I can say is don't waste your time or money ($25) if you want sushi. There are numerous sushi joints that serve a much higher quality of sushi.

There is nothing under the table or in the seat. 

I emptied the contents of my wallet into the table in front of her.

The bread is chewy while not destroying the roof of your mouth. Beer is served in a great frosty glass mug and tops off the meal perfectly. The dining room seats about 50 and has large tv's in view of every table. The menu is the right size for a neighborhood pizza place but the staff also seemed willing to go off menu and make other dishes.

The bone in rib eye ($60) is their showcased steak. It was huge but Pete did not leave a morsel on the plate. They don't advertise it but they will serve a petite filet mignon (8oz $45). The filet on the menu is 10oz for $52. They also didn't state creamed spinach on the menu but they do offer it. I loved how they made things off the menu.

The entrees - we all did the surf and turf option (ok, ok, out thanksgiving is not Norman Rockwell, but how do you pass that up?!?), had a turkey leg added for the table, whipped sweet potatoes and Brussel sprouts.   The steaks and lobster were perfectly prepared, and the cartilage had even been removed from the shelled claw.  For my taste the steak could have used a fraction more butter or salt, but it was great!  My favorite was the Ritz cracker stuffing with small lobster bits in it.  I would come back next thanksgiving just for that Ritz cracker stuffing (is one permitted to say the word ""Ritz"" inside a 4 Seasons hotel!?!?!?)!

The maître de and hostess were talking together the whole time and not watching what was going on in their restaurant. Very poor experience!!!,2015-07-10 01:11:47,0

It is so tasty that I haven't bothered yet to try their burgers. Their poutine competes with some of the best examples of this classical Quebec dish in Montreal, the paprika adds and extra flavour.

WOW! What a bad story it was. To read...

- Their hotdog at $ 7.75 is just a vulgar hotdog sausage (which Tousignant claims to be made from 100% local beef and beef). Okay. But after having tasted it, I judge that the proportion is rather 30% of their 100% local meat ... mixed with 70% of bad fillings. But it's definitely a little better than the Hygrade sausage!

- Their cheeseburger at $ 7.50 is a shame for the smallness of its meat and its small slice of Kraft cheese. If at least it was a fresh slice of thicker Cheddar. But tomatos and onions are cut into very thick slices ... with a lot of iceberg lettuce. Wow!

- If you like fries dull and greasy, go Chez Tousignant!

- If you order chicken to take-out, make sure your cup of BBQ sauce is not only half filled ... and that your chicken piece is full before you leave.

Do not deign to complain about their incompetence, unless you accept to be humiliated to have done it by the Chef himself. The service is nonchalant and haughty.",2017-05-31 22:43:32,0

I'm a foodie that embraces the grease and all the fat things possible so from the smell of it I liked it right when I stepped in. Small little place, a few tables and also high tables which I think are cool and you can't find much like that in restos anymore. The staff is friendly and I love the open kitchen concept. 

BUT sorry to disappoint all you readers. It was a disappointment. I got the small poutine and a tousignant cheese burger. The poutine sauce was decent but wasn't thick enough. Flavour could have been better. Fries got soggy super fast. They weren't crispy, wasn't potatoey enough for my liking. I do appreciate that the cheese was scattered everywhere and not just in the middle of the bowl. The sauce should have been so much hotter where it could melt the cheese curds because when I was eating it the cheese was still cold and hard. A good poutine has to be a balance of squeaky cheese and melty strings as well. The fries needs to be crispier, I suggest frying it twice so it keeps its crispiness longer. 

The burger was dry and nothing special. The burger meat was lacking seasoning and flattened too much where it lost all its juices. Burger was topped with cheese, purple onions, pickles, tomato, lettuce and their special Sauce (tasted like a spicy mayo).

I got the Green Eggs & Ham sandwich and my wife had a half Vegetalian which even though it was a half was still huge. She's not a vegetarian but leans that way when we go out to eat sometimes.

The Vegetalian has thinly shredded lettuce and hot pepper relish on it to do a halfway convincing job of mimicking a real Italian sub but without the delicious cured meats.

I can't believe I haven't made it out here until today. I've always heard so many good things about it, but just never went because I thought it was just ""another sandwich place"".

It's a pretty modern deli, also a wine bar. I came here around lunch time and it was sort of a long wait, but it was worth it! It seems like they make a lot of their food fresh (also cut their meats on the spot), so you know that everything is made with lots of love and tastiness. I think we ended up waiting for about 20ish mins to get our food.

I got the Hoboken - this might be the first and only roast beef sandwich that I really enjoyed. The beef tasted like actual beef, instead of deli meat (if that makes sense?).

We started off a group of five being sat at a dirty table, which could only hold four. After squishing a bit we finally just pulled another dirty table to make it more comfortable. We sat there for a long time before any greeting occurred after finally waving the server down she grabbed our order. Few minutes later she comes with two of the five drinks ( conveniently only the drinks the two males ordered). Anyways, after another wait food finally arrived which was yet again all the stuff the men ordered. Us ladies got our food eventually, but our drinks only got delivered after asking again. We sat there hoping to get any service. We had to ask MULTIPLE times before receiving any chopsticks, plates or napkins. These are normal standard things a tables requires when dining. And, of course, getting the bill took 15 minutes of the server avoiding eye contact until finally we yelled for her. We couldn't wait to leave. 
Also, while we sat there all other tables that left never got cleared, the severs would disappear for long periods of time. And it wasn't just us who were unhappy all the tables around us were audibly complaining. In fact, the table beside us whom had children had to physically go find napkins. That's rule number one for tables with children, they are going to need napkins. 
To be honest I don't know if the servers were really under staffed, one of the servers mentioned that the 'other girl was new'. But that didn't excuse HER service. I am a server and based on the number of tables it honestly didn't make sense how behind they were. 
In the end I couldn't even enjoy my food, sure it was alright. But when you're getting such awful service where everything is a struggle you can't really just sit and relax. Therefore, I'd never come back.

The almond croissant- INCREDIBLE, they make only a set amount in the morning so you get 'em while they're hot or until they're sold out. Its flaky and light with the perfect amount of sweetness- they truly melt in your mouth. 

Quiche with Spinach and goat cheese- simplistic and savory, my only wish was that it was larger. The crust on it was killer- served with a salad with house dressing (homemade ranch)

Eggs Florentine- One of my favorite benedicts of all time, perfectly sized potions that won't leave you hungry or regretting your last few bites.

We tried to eat considering our 14month old was tired & we were hungry assuming they were figuring something out or may have the manager come out and apologize but nope, still nothing. I could not finish my food more so from being upset at the way we were treated & how this issue was handled ( or wasn't handled for better words) Again, we weren't looking for a free meal considering you pay before you get your food or service but a little apology or something would go a long way.

A footnote to this is that as we were on our way to another restaurant, I called and asked to speak to the owner. I was told he was not there, but she could help me.

Brian, owner, and his staff are churning out grilled cheese like mom used to make....and some mom has never even heard of. 

Gotta hand it the menu for these fellas. You can certainly venture for au originale or something a little more on the adventurous end of the culinary spectrum. Can't say there is anything better than a standard grilled cheese, but the varieties with pork, southwestern chicken, leek & mushroom, and the dessert option with nutella are certainly worth shaking a stick at. 

We all know a grilled cheese is best accompanied by soup, chips, or something comparable. Brian has you covered. Rosemary and truffle chips and the tomato soup are available to turn your sammy into a dynamic duo. Pair these jokers with beer from Triple C and you're well on your way to a fine meal fit for the streets of Crown Town.

Prices can seem a little steep at first, but do yourself a favor and talk to Brian or the staff about what kinds of cheese they're utilizing. You'll be happy you did. Also, they have Square, so those of you with no cashola, fear not.

Yes, it is true, Ra tried to kill me. I went to this Ra, not following my mantra ABRA (anything but Ra) and met my parents for dinner. For some unknown reason they love Ra. I figured , what the hell, it's their favorite place so I'll just roll with it. (or sashimi with it) The food was fine for Ra standards, all I had was my  normal assorted sashimi plate with a side bowl of rice. Keep in mind I eat sushi almost every week, and sometimes twice a week. Only once before did I get a little sick from sushi, if I remember correctly, I didn't touch the stuff for like 6 months :( 

When you get some sort of ""food poisoning"" you really try to figure out what the hell went wrong that day. As I awoke Sunday a bit itchy, I noticed some small red spots appearing and disappearing. Throughout the day I realized, I was have an allergic reaction to ""something"" I have NO allergies, so this is new for me. 

As I thought back, I had to blame the sushi, it was the only unique thing I had all day. I kept wondering, what fish was to blame? The tuna, octopus, white fish, salmon? I think the culprit was either the white fish or octopus, I eat neither that often. 

I have to say, having the ""hives"" isn't as much fun as listening to The Hives.

Tons of board games to choose from and lots of people to meet and have fun with. My friends and I decided to come here for board games and lattes. But the barista went home early on a Saturday night. 

So where we're the lattes? Why do you have such a cool menu but can't order half the items from it? Lattes, not available. Drip coffee, not available. Hot chocolate , not available. You aren't giving your customers much to choose from except water, alcohol and food. Yet the name suggests lattes... How come no one in the cafe was able to serve us coffees? Aren't you listed as a cafe? Not even an attempt to accommodate this request. 

The hostess looked stressed, our server was not attentive and the lack of customer service was disappointing. I'm torn between writing a good review because the concept of your establishment is different and forward thinking but the staff has to learn a few things about customer service and how to be more attentive to the needs of it's guests. 

No one wants to wait 30 mins for a drink order. No one bothered to come around and ask if we wanted something more to drink after our first round. After trying to hunt down our server and settle up with her, the automatic 18% gratuity was the only option available when paying debit. But your service was horrible. Again, not giving your customers many options here. 

I'm disappointed in the service and menu options. You've done a great job with the interior, it's new, fresh and modern ,but what keeps customers coming back is customer care and establishing personal relationships with the visitors who frequent your tables and pay for your tips. Be more attentive. Show that you care. Work there because you love it.

I knew about the chef on Instagram for awhile (go follow them @epiceriehao), and have been hyping to try his bao. In short, he delivered. Actually, the experience exceeded my expectations. From the interior design, to the superb service, and of course the awesome food - I will be back every time I'm in the city. 

Going into detail, the interior is a super minimal, and small space. Overall, the attention to detail is impeccable, with everything serving a specific purpose - the sink, bar table, etc. The aura of the restaurant gives a sense of excellence. I appreciated being in such a tasteful, aesthetically pleasing space. The service was very friendly. The cashier was attentive to all the guests that came in and, was very engaging in conversation. She took care of my friends - providing complimentary green tea, as well as accommodating for any extra utensils. In all, she is the perfect person to be welcoming patrons into the restaurant and serving them beyond expectations. 

I tried the vegetarian buns, green salad, and matcha roll cake. Starting off with the buns, normally I don't go for the veg option but these surpassed all my beliefs. A true symphony of flavours and textures. The ridiculously soft, airy, perfect amount of chew bun. Along with delicious combination of tofu, mushroom and peppers sauced with Japanese Kewpie mayo, and topped with crispy onions and coriander. All together they create an ideal combo, both in flavour, aroma, and texture. Next was the green salad, a yummy mix of greens with a satisfying balance of crunch, sweetness, tart, and savoury. Last but not least is the, matcha green cake. A delicate, but sublime array of flavours. With the perfect amount of matcha essence within the cake portion of the desert, and a light creamy filling. So good, that we ordered seconds. 

I highly recommend, stopping by HAO if you're ever in Montreal. They provide a delicious meal, and first rate service. Along with a beautiful space to eat in. Thank you, HAO!",2017-03-15 23:15:26,1

I ordered the pork buns and it turned out to be much smaller than expected. The flavor is nice, but I think the vegetarian one tastes better (I had a bite of my friend's vege buns). I like the plating, I didn't expect buns to be serve in such fancy way. Even though it tastes good, it is not really worth 10,5$.

A couple of friends and I visited on a weekend trip and made a note to visit HAO as a) it had great reviews, b) the pictures looked beautiful, and c) (perhaps most importantly for us) it was conveniently close to our AirBnB. Your reason for visiting should be d) none of the above, because in a foodie city where mainstays such as Au Pied de Cochon, Joe Beef, and Schwartz dominate the headlines all the time, we should all be paying a little more attention to the smaller establishments that offer a much friendlier and more accessible food experience. 

First, the food: as many reviews mentioned, HAO embraces the ""less is more"" philosophy and offers a pared down menu of the essentials - baos consisting of a pork or a vegetarian (tofu) filling, topped with garlic crisps, in between white, fluffy buns; dumplings; cucumber salads. We tried both the pork and tofu buns and the cucumber salad. The pork buns were good, but to my surprise, the tofu ones were my favorite. I am always impressed by vegetarian options that really mimic both the taste and texture of meat it is substituting, this is was outstanding; the tofu absorbed the flavors even better than the pork. My only nit-picky comment is that the buns fall apart easily, so it's difficult to eat with your hands or get the perfect bun to filling ratio. The cucumber salad is nothing to write home about, but you gotta balance your meal with vegetables. 

Next, the service: I went in a group of 6 and Rachelle was more than receptive and helpful. She explained every dish available on the menu (everything was in French) and despite the limited space, she pulled up chairs and set us up, happily made sure we got water and kept a keen eye on our glasses in case we needed a refill. Because it wasn't as busy while we were there, she struck up conversation and gave us local recommendations. It was really clear that she works very hard to give every customer the best experience. 

Finally, the story: Rachelle runs HAO with her brothers. The entire interior of the store was designed by one of her brothers and the recipes and cooking is done by the other. She seems to run the storefront and marketing for the store, and told us how everything came to be; at first, they started as a small catering service and then slowly grew from there until they got a storefront. The store is about a year old now, but they're going to expand to have a large seating area as there is a vacancy in the space next door. It was really inspiring and heartwarming to hear how hard Rachelle and her family worked so hard to get HAO off the ground and clearly they're all very invested in it still - we even saw her mom coming in!

All in all, I really enjoyed my visit and urge everyone to visit for the food and to support an awesome local business!",2017-11-19 00:22:24,0

I LOVE good Mexican food, and unfortunately for us 'Burghers, we are at a terrible shortage of excellent Mexican options here in the Steel City. However, after a visit to El Toro Loco, my opinion has changed.

I've been meaning to try this place out for a while, frequently passing it and going to Patron instead. Sorry Patron, you've been kicked to the curb.

So the reason I went here was because I heard they had a Taco Tuesday special all day, as well as Thursday. 99 cent Beef soft or hard.

The tacos were filled with perfectly seasoned ground beef, and topped with fresh lettuce, diced tomato and shredded Americanized cheddar. I would have preferred a Mexican style cheese but I'll take an authentic taco shell over cheese any day.

The reason I like this place better than patron is simple - they actually season their meat. That, and the complimentary chips were hot and fresh, and the salsa was spicy, home made , and had lots of cilantro. 

Soft drinks were super sized and had free refills. (Coke products). TV scenario is excellent at the bar and the specials are ridiculous every day. See posted pictures.

I love to eat out, so I have been to a lot of places in my life, and I can say with 100% certainty that as of the date that I am writing this review, this is hands down THE WORST restaurant I have ever had the displeasure of going to. My group was fairly large (8 people), so we expected to wait for a table on Taco Tuesday. Well, we got to the door and there was a sign that said ""No taco Tuesday special today."" Okay, whatever, that's fine. We still wanted tacos. And margaritas. When it was our turn to sit, we were seated in an alcove behind a wall upstairs. It was kind of weird, but nice to have the privacy in a way. As soon as we sat down, we were brought chips and salsa, which seemed great (the salsa was clearly not freshly made by the way...), but then trouble began. 

With a large group, it is easy to get distracted talking to each other, so finally, it became clear that we had been there for 15 or 20 minutes and no one had come by to take our drink order. We snagged a passing server, and he looked startled and said he'd take our orders. Everyone ordered the house margarita in various sizes  except for one person who ordered a corona, and we got some queso for an appetizer. Ten minutes pass...twenty minutes pass...we ask the server about our drinks and he assures us they will be right out. Tick tock, tick tock...thirty minutes pass. Okay, this was getting ridiculous. After 43 minutes (yes, I timed it), drinks were brought to the table in tiny plastic dixie cups. None of them had salt or a lime, and none of them were more than 8 oz., certainly not 'jumbo'. I looked around at everyone sipping their margarita mix (no alcohol?!) and wondered why I had no drink. The server said it was coming right out. I was getting agitated, so I went downstairs to talk to a manager and was told that she was too busy to speak with me. The margarita I ordered came out 23 minutes after the rest of the drinks and the server brought me the queso at the same time. It was cold and congealed. So, after being at the restaurant for nearly an hour and a half, we had not even had our order taken. We tried to order food and another round of drinks, but they never came. I headed down to the bar to order beers and was told by a bartender to ""hold on like ten minutes"", but was never served. Two girls by the bar told me they were leaving because they hadn't been served at their table or the bar in almost an hour. It was busy, but not busy enough that I couldn't easily walk up to the bar. The bartenders were literally doing nothing.

My friend's studio is across the street and this is the default place we go to. This is probably the best Chinese Food restaurant that I've been because the offering is so unique from what is offered everywhere. Everything they made was different and good.

The food is very spicy and have heavy spices which I love. We just order from the BBQ menu. This is what we had:

BBQ Mushroom: super delicious and juicy
BBQ Dried Tofu: My friend's a vegetarian and ordered this, it was good
BBQ Potato Slices: This taste like fresh potato chips, yummy
BBQ Sausage: My favourite! Juicy and beefy with a sweet flavour Sooo GOOD!
BBQ Chicken: Cooked just right where it's cooked and still juicy.
BBQ Whole Shrimp: 4 shrimps on a skewer. Spicy and delicious shrimps

We came here during the evening after dinner on a weekend so it was a full-house without a line up. The waitresses seemed ignored us as we waited at the door while we were waiting even after tables were cleared and people left. After waiting for 10 mins and no acknowledgement, I stopped a waitress and asked if we could get a table. She rudely told us to follow her and wait which ended up causing us to awkwardly stand in the middle of the restaurant for another 10 minutes. She finally sat us down in the corner of the restaurant which had a sticky, wet table. Of course, she didn't bother to wipe it down for us.

Because we were sat down in the front corner of the restaurant, a line that formed at the entrance blocked our views from the waitresses so it was difficult to call to their attention to begin our ordering. We ordered several beef, lamb, and chicken wing skewers. Despite the many reviews here, the skewers were average in taste. One of the skewers was dropped from the plate onto our table as it was being served to us. Unsurprisingly, the waitress picked it up and tried to serve it to a different customer.

Due to the unpleasant and rude service that was provided, we decided to not leave a tip. After paying for our order at the front and leaving, the waitress called us back and showed me the bill saying that they were missing a tip from us.

I've gotten to know Lee and his fun crew.  They know about our shop, they were the first restaurant to see our new son a week fresh--back when he'd sleep in his stroller heh.

So Katz, why are you wanting to go here?  I'll tell you.  They open early, for a breakfast that is hearty.  Want an omelet? Expect a full platter.  Our favorite is the 2-2-2, eggs, pancakes, bacon--inexpensive and hearty. They have some of the areas best hash browns which are more the potato chunky crunchy seasoned style.

After morning you're always served some pickles and slaw.  A nice primer for a meal.  I don't know the history but I enjoy it.

For lunch I have 2 go-to's.  The Philly with a side of mayo, or a half-reuben (whole if I'm ridiculously ravenous else it's waay too much.), add a basket of fries and we're good to go.  The reuben is open faced style with your choice of corned beef or pastrami styles--you can go 1/2 and 1/2 too.  Piled high with kraut, sauce and cheese. 

The philly on the other hand is on a crispy toasted roll loaded with brisket, mushrooms, onions and cheese.  Really tasty and hearty.

My wife Robin many times will get a 1 potato 2 potato which is like  plate of meat and mash with applesauce.  She loves it, and I don't argue.

Their bagel/knish platters are par for the course and I believe they now source fully from Poppy's Bagels which gets a lot of local kudos from me.

Now for the finisher.. If that wasn't enough get their blintz as a dessert.. You'll get stapled to the couch for a while.  Luckily a secret is you can order a 1/2 order of them (1 blintz) and it's the perfect side.  Sided with sour cream and blueberries.

The only thing I as a hearty foodie of natural product origin would like to see is-- when fruits are in season, I wish Lee would buy them.  Fresh blueberries, strawberries or peaches  with the blintz would be killer.  The other thing is we bring our own maple syrup (grade B baby!) because they have those old school corn-syrup-flavored-maple things and for the style of their breakfast it just doesn't do their product justice.  It's all probably a cost but it's points that could take it higher.

They are like family and will get to know you over time so say hi for me when you're in! :D",2011-09-25 17:36:06,1

I won't wax nostalgic for the previous iteration of Katz' Deli, with its 3-inch-high corned beef sandwiches, half-sours & dills at the table when you sit down, the NY groove. Instead I'll just say (to the new owners, whom I respect), please clean the place up. Take down the sun-bleached old posters. Repaint. Put up some NY-themed artwork. Up your game. Stack your sandwiches. Debone your whitefish. Bake your own black & whites. Give us a deli we can count on. We really, really need a good deli in Charlotte.",2015-11-09 14:18:27,0

We ordered Pani Puri, Vada Sambar, and Masala Dosa. Things went downhill pretty soon. Now being born and raised in India, I am always (consciously or not) searching for a taste of ""authenticity"" when it comes to Indian dishes. Especially when an Indian restaurant lists regional street food (like Papri Chaat, Paani Puri, Vadas) in their menus, it generates high level of expectations along with great anticipation especially for immigrants to relive memories of their childhood, holidays and decadent street food in their original homeland. Some tastes are not to be messed with, even to try and justify the changes as innovation or ""to make it more suitable for North American taste-buds"".

 I shall start with the Vada Sambar first. It was A TRAVESTY to say the least. I have been having Vada Sambar for over 28 years and have tasted it in different parts of India and outside of India too. This was the first time I saw anything like this. The Vadas came soaked in the Sambar, making them soggy and listless. One essential rule of thumb of Indian cuisine is that the bread cannot be soggy and if it loses its crunchiness, its unacceptable for the plate. Hold on,this is not over. As I took a small sample of the Sambar, I was confused. For the uninitiated, sambar is a lentil dish which is made with lots of vegetables (like eggplants and okra) and an essential ingredient in it is tamarind. Sambar is not authentic Sambar if not tempered with tamarind and a specific blend of spices (sambar powder). Here, the sambar they gave us, forget the T of tamarind, did not even have a single V of any vegetables. It was an unrecognizable flavor of a daal mocking to be sambar! The disappointment did not end here. 

The masala dosa came next. Though it was as spicy as it claimed to be, the sauces/daals it came with again proved to be a blunder. Dosas, nowhere in the dosa world is ever served with pudina (mint) chutney. It is always accompanied by two lentil dishes, yellow sambar and the white coconut sauce. Here maybe because there was a third compartment in the tray and they didnt want it to remain empty, filled it up with pudina (mint) chutney. Guys, pudina and dosas do not go together. And they are not MEANT to be together either. What is meant to be together is Tamarind and Sambar. Please get chefs who are aware of complementing flavours of Indian spices, sauces. It seems they are stuck in generic North Indian onion-ginger-garlic paste flavoured dishes and needs some training in managing other regional food varieties. By this time, my disappointment had reached such a high level that I just wanted to end the experience and leave. I am a puchhka (another regional version of paani-puri) lover at heart and always felt that I am cheating on puchhka if I happened to like a paani-puri. Thanks to this restaurant, my loyalty to pucchka remains steadfast.",2016-10-03 04:05:20,0

Their eggs benedicts are delicious - and they have pesto hollandais sauce which is a lot tastier and less heavy than usual hollandais sauce in my opinion. I've tried both the BAB (Bacon, Avocado, and Brie) and their Veggie Pesto Benedicts. Their benedicts are priced at ~ 9$-11$ which is probably the best you'll find in Montreal. 

This place does get pretty busy on the weekends but their service is fast and I've never had to wait more than ~20 minutes.

Last day in Montreal and we were looking for a good breakfast place, but the only reason why I left satisfied was because I was full. The only thing that really deserved a great rating was the fact that most of my meal was pretty good.

I ordered the BAB (brie, avocado, bacon) eggs benedict, and I actually liked it. Eggs weren't anything special because their hollandaise mixture was kind of bland to me, but I especially liked the melted brie and the avocado/bacon-to-muffin ratio that accompanied it. The bacon was crisp and my avocado was super green so I'm glad it wasn't sitting out and browning for awhile. The cheese was melted to perfection on the toasted English muffins too! It was large amount of food for me and it seemed to be fitting for its price. However, the water given was for some reason pretty warm...? I wasn't sure if this is custom in Canada since it was the second restaurant we went to that served warm or room-temperature water. We asked for ice and they gave us only a couple of cubes enough for one cup, but it melted within minutes.

Customer service was alright, our waitress seemed unenthusiastic about serving us, but at least she wasn't totally rude.

I'm a bit surprised that everyone loved the service: the waitress was..just there. Not particularly enthusiastic about..anything at all really. 

My friend ordered the Standard, without meat, she loved it! The plates are actually big, which was a lovely surprise - they look fairly small in pictures! I got the french toast, which was also huge, and sprinkled with cinnamon, some fruits and granola. It comes with a side of plain yogurt and a little tin of actual maple syrup. I would have enjoyed more if it had been warm and freshly made. For a $14 plate of bread, I was disappointed.

My friend loved (loved! loved!) her coffee. Neither of us expected it since she got a simple filtered coffee and not a fancy latte/expresso..She loved it so much that she asked our aloof waitress to give her the specifics.

They were beyond disrespectful and when we just said we are going to return it (since they refused to correct it) they yelled at us.

Our babies are too little for a high chair, so always stay in their car seat in the stroller that pushes up to tables. We have eaten at a number of fine restaurants, and all have accommodated us, never have we had an issue. We've eaten at Ruth Chris with them, to small diners like this restaurant, never a problem. Until today. After waiting 20 minutes in the waiting room, the manager told the hostess that we were not allowed to bring the stroller in. He did this through a windowed door in the back of the restaurant. Never once coming to talk with us. I saw 2 tables that would perfectly fit the stroller and was told no. One was for a larger party and he refused for us to sit there and at another table that would've worked perfectly that was a smaller table. A number of customers were appalled at how we were treated, refused service, after taking all the right steps to enjoy a nice lunch after going to a nearby pumpkin patch.

Usually on the opening night service is amazing, so I gave it another shot to see how it is going to be on a regular pay for your food people night :)))
Both times service and the food were amazing.This is a perfect place for burger lover who wants a bit more sophisticated options and HUGE variety of gourmet choices. 

Good:
Details: Quality of food is plain great, from the fresh meat patties, variety of cheeses, buns, and of course absolutely crazy amount of toppings.
Drinks come in glass measuring cups, onion rings is a candle holder tower, food itself comes in a metal square tray. Salt and pepper shakers are in a shape of light bulbs. All of it fits the theme,decor and works quite well.

Atmosphere: One of my favorite parts of this restaurant (and yes I would definitely call this a restaurant not just a burger joint you drop into) that it has all the details of an actual sit down dinner. I do not feel like I am in dirty, grimy burger joint.
Their pick up door/line it tucked away in a smart way so it does not disturb actual patrons who came for a sit down dinner. Low level of music also brings a nice change from usually blasting tunes of other burger places.

Food: Decadent mushrooms, crispy onion rings that come with most creamy chipotle mayo( you can choose from a variety of dips), HUGE juicy beef patty that smells and taste like a real piece of meat. Perfectly fried sweet potato strings (no dirty oil smell or burned pieces). Melting in your mouth cheese (brie in my case), fresh crunch of vegetables or smooth feel of avocado it all is plain amazing! Incredible 6!! strips of crispy perfectly smoked bacon with cheese melted around it like a blanket...

Bad:
The only thing I did not like were dill crisps (deep fried pickles). They are usually my favorite item on the menu, and I gladly pay an upgrade price for them. But they were just plain awful :(

I suppose if your experience with hamburgers is with fast food joints like burger king, McDonlads an hero burger etc. then you will probably really enjoy the burgers here.

My experience with this place was disappointing to say the least, I guess I fell for the word ""Gourmet"" which led me to believe that these were fresh, handmade burgers with gourmet toppings. The reality is, the only thing  ""Gourmet"" about this place is the selection of premium toppings, which are impressive. But that's where it all stops, what I got was a dry, over cooked, chewy and quite flavourless beef burger which tasted and looked like a previously frozen and very likely manufactured beef patty that  was very likely made in a factory somewhere. 

There was absolutely nothing gourmet about the actual burgers. especially for that price... My experience was was total and utter disappointment if i wasn't so hungry i would have thrown out the burger. But I just didn't feel like complaining, it wasn't worth it as it was nothing they could change without changing everything they do lol, so i just ate as much as i could, paid my bill and left. Noting to myself that i was duped and that this was a place i was sure i would never return to.

Belfiore's had decent reviews, so we figured what the heck.  What the heck, indeed.  Although the bakery side was modest and somewhat welcoming, the restaurant side looks like it used to be a Kyoto Bowl with some Italian art thrown on the wall. 

It was right around 8pm on Saturday night when we showed up, and there were 3 other tables with guests.   Despite the low number of other patrons, our waitress - although sweet - forgot we were there after she served our drinks.

I wasn't very hungry, and all I wanted was something along the lines of a capellini pomodoro with fresh tomato chunks, basil and garlic.  The closest they had was tomato sauce.  I should point out here that it was my boyfriend who found Belfiore's on Yelp, so I hadn't read the reviews and had no idea that their portions were so huge.  It was like they had taken an entire box of pasta, cooked it, and scooped it on my plate and then opened a can of tomato sauce and dumped it on top.  I really don't know how one can possibly screw up the easiest dish on the menu, but Belfiore's found a way.  I could barely eat it.  They could easily cut that dish in half, keep the price the same ($10) and add fresh tomatoes and basil and still make a good profit.  Their portions do nothing but add to the ever-increasing American waistline.

My boyfriend's dish fared better - penne with vodka sauce and shrimp - although the shrimp was overcooked.

The seniors spoke so highly of the place, so I was happy to take them to lunch there on a few occasions.  Each visit became increasingly worse.  

Now, for the record, Belfiore DOES have pretty good food, so if you don't care about poor customer service and just want your food, this is the place to go.  But, if you are planning on having a group larger than 4 people to meet for lunch, run away.  The server/waitress was short-tempered, rude and carried an air of superiority.  She referred to everyone as ""sweetie"", ""darling"" or ""baby"" which was delivered in a harsh tone (offering little as an endearing term).  Each person was served one at a time, so it left others staring at the lucky recipient wishing that they had something to eat.  The drinks were served in cheap styrofoam containers with a plastic lid and when asked to refill, she abruptly responded, ""It's not FREE,"" snatched up said cup and stormed off.  

For some reason, I foolishly agreed to 2 return trips after the first until finally I had to insist that we NEVER go again.  They all agreed and we haven't returned since.  

Belfiore owners:  please work on your customer service.  It's super simple.  Politeness goes a long way.  If you see that other restaurants are offering it, you may want to consider (at least) duplicating the same system (i.e. refills, reusable cups, service to a whole party at one time, etc.).  

Once again, if customer service is of no consequence to you and decent Italian food is your only desire, then this is the place for you.",2014-08-16 22:24:47,0

 I went with a large group of friends and we tried many of their offerings. All of the food was served timely and the service was very friendly! Our maid drew a cat on our omu rice and led us in a ""magic spell"" to make it taste better :3 The food is all made quite well, though personally I don't believe that the matcha parfait is worth the price. 

The reason you come to this location is for the experience, and that's truly what we got, we were even allowed to out on maid costumes and take photos! I will be coming back the next time I'm in Toronto",2017-07-25 21:19:25,1

And today, I was in for a surprise, the lighting suddenly got dimmed and four of the servers dressed in French maid customs started dancing with amazing energy and they all seemed so happy.  My impression is that they really enjoy the dancing part.  Some patrons even got up to mini stage and started dancing.  I felt so much happier after they finished performing.  I got a little size tracked, the matcha mousse was creamy and tasty with a lot of matcha flavour balanced well by the creaminess of the whipped cream topping and red bean paste.  It was just a wonderful treat.  Thank you Uncle Tetsu!",2016-08-18 23:43:37,1

On the first part of our visit, we ordered two Strawberry Angel cheesecake; alongside with the Matcha latte and Yuzu mousse and were quite satisfied. The atmosphere was refreshing, as if you were in a cafe located in Japan and the servers (all dressed in maid and host outfits) were accommodating for the most part, except when they started coming back to our table, disrupting our conversation over and over again asking if we want to order more or if we wanted more water.

We only discovered about the show time that day from multiple hosts and decided to come back in an hour after notifying one of the maids/hosts of our subsequent return. Later on in the evening, we decided to come back again to watch the performances as the servers invited us and right when we walked in; they insisted to have us seated despite us telling them beforehand that we are not there to order more as we had just came about an hour ago. Prior to being seated, we planned on simply watching from afar leaning on the walls not trying to take up a seat. Initially, we thought that they were just trying to be really accommodating to their customers, but when we were about to walk out after the performances ended, the ""MC"" or as someone we presumed as the café's manager called us out for apparently ""taking up space"" for the other customers as he saw that we did not order any more. We tried to explain to him our situation and how prior to us coming to see the performance, we had already ordered and payed. However, instead of apologizing for the misunderstanding, he still insisted on the fact that we did not order from the cafe and that he was under the impression that we were to just watch the show without having ordered at all; causing us to just walk out abruptly. 

I have never been to a restaurant or a cafe who treated me like that before. I have found it extremely rude and patronizing to be confronted like that in front of a crowd of people, especially by someone who was acknowledged as the host of the show prior to this altercation. I would have given this review a 4 because of the food but I would not recommend it to anyone as the management and customer service is really poor. 

As for that manager who called us out; I am not sure where you had your education but please go back to school and relearn management, customer service and even an intro to marketing again because that is NOT how you treat your customers. If there is something not working out in your cafe, you do not blame the people buying and sitting in your cafe, but speak to your staff members to fix the problems that you see. Regardless of whether individuals would like to view your show without ordering, the manager should never have to call out an audience member. Those audience members could potentially bring up a returns for the stores in forms such as buzz via word of mouth, social media exposure, and a positive review on sites such as this. If that MC or management team is reading this, I hope you take this to heart and make adjustments with how you treat customers and how you control your flows of communication within your staff.",2016-05-09 14:22:45,0

The service was so terrible that I took them time to sign up for yelp just to write this review. First of all, this is not my first time coming here in fact I came here twice before. Today me and my friends decided to get some dessert at this cafe after having dinner. My friends order an angel cake and pudding while I order a vanilla ice cream. A few minutes later my friends dessert came first while I was still waiting on mine. After waiting  20 minutes, I asked the maid if the ice cream was ready she said it would be out in 5-10 minutes since it takes time to freeze. Another 20 minutes as passed and I see some sundae and parfait coming out hoping my ice cream would be next. Nope it never came!!!!! I called the maid again and she check to see if it was ready only to tell me it was sold out. Are you f*$#ing kidding me. I waited basically an hour for an ice cream that never came. She could of told an hour ago that they were sold out and that I could of order something else. Even a soft serve from an ice truck doesnt take an hour to make.   I would rather wait an hour in line at sweet jesus knowing that at least I would get ice cream.",2016-07-28 03:33:33,0
